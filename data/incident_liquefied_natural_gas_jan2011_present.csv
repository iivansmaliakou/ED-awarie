NITROGEN MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE TANK, PRIOR TO THE INITIAL START-UP, BY FLOWING NATURAL GAS INTO THE TANK IN ORDER TO DISPLACE THE NITROGEN.    THE FACILITY AND ITS PRIMARY CONTRACTOR DEVELOPED A PROCEDURE FOR CARRYING OUT THE NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT INITIALLY INCLUDED DIRECTING THE VENT STREAM TO THE LP FLARE. LATER, THE PROCEDURE WAS AMENDED TO PROVIDE FOR VENTING OF THE NITROGEN VIA A ROOF VENT ON THE LNG TANK.  THE FACILITY COMPLETED A MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (""MOC"") EVALUATION FOR THE AMENDED PROCEDURE, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY OPERATIONS, COMMISSIONING, AND ENGINEERING.  ACCORDING TO THE AMENDED PROCEDURE, THE VENTING WOULD BE MONITORED TO DETERMINE WHEN THE NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT WOULD BE COMPLETE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE TANK CONTENTS WOULD BE SWITCHED TO THE LP FLARE.     VENTING OF NITROGEN FROM THE TANK BEGAN ON JANUARY 15, 2022 AT APPROXIMATELY 0300 AND ENDED ON JANUARY 17, 2022 AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS WHEN FACILITY ENVIRONMENTAL PERSONNEL BECAME AWARE OF THE VENTING AND POTENTIAL FOR NATURAL GAS TO BE PRESENT IN THE VENT STREAM.  OPERATIONS WERE PROTECTIVELY CEASED PRIOR TO CONFIRMATION OF THE PRESENCE AND/OR QUANTITY OF ANY NATURAL GAS IN THE VENT.  LATER, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NATURAL GAS MIXED WITH NITROGEN WAS IN FACT EMITTED.     THE PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE EXCLUSION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST/ AIR PERMITTING SPECIALIST IN THE SIGN-OFF APPROVAL OF THE MOC. IF THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS INCLUDED IN THE MOC PROCESS, THE MOC WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN EXECUTED SINCE THE LNG TANK IS NOT AN APPROVED EMISSION SOURCE.     TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE, ANY NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITY USING NATURAL GAS WILL EITHER DIRECT ANY VENT STREAM PURGED FROM THE LNG STORAGE TANKS TO A FLARE OR SUCH ACTIVITY WILL BE PERMITTED PURSUANT TO THE REGULATORY PERMIT IN LAC 33:III.309 OR OTHER APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. IN ADDITION, THE FACILITY WILL ENSURE THAT ANY VENTING PROCEDURE AND ANY CHANGES THERETO ARE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED DURING THE MOC PROCESS AND ARE APPROVED BY APPROPRIATE AND RELEVANT STAFF, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL STAFF, IN ADDITION TO OPERATIONS AND ENGINEERING STAFF. FINALLY, ANY PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN NITROGEN PURGING OPERATIONS FOR THE LNG STORAGE TANKS WILL RECEIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING ON THE PROCEDURES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO ANY FUTURE NITROGEN DISPLACEMENT OPERATIONS."

THE CRACK WAS IDENTIFIED DIRECTLY BELOW THE EXISTING LNG PUMP CATWALK/PLATFORM AND APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT ABOVE THE DOME LIP/COMPRESSION EDGE. THE OPERATOR ON DUTY NOTIFIED MANAGEMENT OF A POTENTIAL LEAK ON TOP OF THE LNG STORAGE AS EVIDENCED BY A VAPOR CLOUD. PLANT MANAGEMENT INFORMED THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC OF THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE AND REQUESTED THAT HE INVESTIGATE IT IMMEDIATELY. THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE AS REQUESTED AND INFORMED THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS THAT IT APPEARED THERE WAS A CRACK IN THE EXTERIOR TANK SHELL. THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS INSTRUCTED THE OPERATOR ON DUTY AND THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC TO SHUTDOWN THE LIQUEFACTION AND TRAILER LOADING ACTIVITIES UNTIL ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COULD TAKE PLACE. THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AND LNG PLANT ENGINEER VISITED THE SITE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE NOTIFICATION BY THE LNG PLANT MECHANIC TO CONFIRM THE FINDINGS. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT A CRACK HAD OCCURRED IN THE CARBON STEEL OUTER TANK AT A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5 FEET. APPROXIMATELY 4 TO 5 YEARS AGO, WITH THE FACILITY UNDER PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP, A LEAK IN AN LNG LIQUID VALVE OCCURRED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE LOCATION OF FAILURE CAUSING DISCOLORATION IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION, KINETREX ENERGY REPLACED THIS VALVE IN OCTOBER 2019 AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR FACILITY. AFTER THE VALVE REPLACEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT COOLDOWN OF THE LINE, THE KINETREX ENERGY PLANT MECHANICS VERIFIED TIGHTNESS OF THE NEWLY INSTALLED VALVE AND NOTATED A SMALL LNG LEAK (A COUPLE OF DROPS/MINUTE) LANDING IN THE EXISTING LNG DRIP PAN PRIOR TO RECTIFYING THIS LEAK. THIS LEAK WAS STOPPED AT THIS TIME. WITH THE DISCOLORATION IT IS PRESUMED THE CARBON STEEL OUTER TANK'S INTEGRITY WAS PREVIOUSLY IMPACTED ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE FAILURE IN 2019. KINETREX ENERGY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING VARIOUS ENGINEERING FIRMS WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, AS WELL AS, MATRIX PDM, THE ORIGINAL TANK MANUFACTURER. MATRIX PDM RECOMMENDED THAT KINETREX ENERGY USE AN EPOXY (BELZONA PRODUCT) TO TEMPORARILY STOP THE LEAK. THE LEAK WAS STOPPED THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 7, 2019 WITH BOIL-OFF GAS NORMAL OPERATION RESUMING. THE INDIANA UTILITY REGULATORY COMMISSION AND A PHMSA REPRESENTATIVE VISITED THE SITE ON NOVEMBER 14, 2019 TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT. SINCE THIS LEAK WAS DISCOVERED, KINETREX ENERGY HAS CONTRACTED WITH MATRIX PDM TO CONDUCT A PHASE I ENGINEERING STUDY. THE ENGINEERING STUDY WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDATION(S), COST(S), AND SCHEDULE TO TEST AND PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE CRACK. THIS REPORT IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED BY MATRIX PDM WITHIN 4 WEEKS. MATRIX PDM HAS SINCE COMPLETED A PHASE I AND II ENGINEERING STUDY OUTLINING THE PROPOSED DESIGN TO PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE CRACK. MATERIAL HAS BEEN PROCURED FOR THIS REPAIR AND IS CURRENTLY ON STANDBY WHILE KINETREX ENERGY BOILS OFF THE REMAINING INVENTORY TO PURGE THE TANK OUT OF SERVICE WITH N2. THE TANK N2 AND AIR PURGE OUT OF SERVICE PROCESS COMPLETED ON OCTOBER 12, 2020 WITH CONSTRUCTION COMMENCING IMMEDIATELY AFTER ON OCTOBER 13, 2020 WITH A COMPLETION DATE OF OCTOBER 22, 2020.

IT WAS FOUND THAT THE OUTLETS OF THE VAPORIZERS GOING INTO PIPELINE WERE GETTING EXTREMELY COLD. THE ESD VALVES DID NOT SHUT AUTOMATICALLY WHICH COULD HAVE ALLOWED LNG INTO THE PIPELINE.  THE TEAM THEN SAW THAT THE LNG PUMPS DID NOT SHUT OFF AND WERE STILL RUNNING.  THE MANUAL VALVES ON THE VAPORIZERS WERE SHUT IN TO ENSURE NO LNG WOULD GET INTO THE PIPELINE.  AT 2250 THE A AND C LNG PUMP EMERGENCY-STOP BUTTONS WERE PUSHED.

THE PILOT RELIEF IS VERY NEAR A GAS DETECTOR HEAD. THE TEAM MEMBER IN THE CONTROL ROOM ANNOUNCED OVER RADIO THAT EVERYONE NEEDED TO GET IN THE CONTROL ROOM.  THE ESD BUTTON WAS THEN MANUALLY PUSHED AT 2339.    AFTER THE VAPORIZERS WERE BLOWN DOWN, THE PLC CABINET WAS OPENED AND THE ETHERNET SWITCH (NNG-GARN-CTRLS-SW-G) WAS FOUND TO BE COVERED IN WATER.

THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE IGNITION WAS A STATIC ELECTRICITY DISCHARGE. AFTER A NITROGEN PURGE OF MORE THAN 12 HOURS, THE PUMP WAS READY TO BE REMOVED FROM ITS WELL. DUE TO STRONG GUST OF WINDS, PRIOR TO LIFTING  THE PUMP, A POLYPROPYLENE ROPE WAS TIED TO ONE OF THE STANDS OF THE BOTTOM SUCTION NOTCH AS AN AID TO CONTROL PUMP MOVEMENTS WHILE BEING TRANSFERRED FROM THE WELL TO THE TRANSPORTATION FRAME. DURING THIS MANEUVER THE TECHNICIAN ATTENDING THE PUMP WAS USING SKIN GLOVES WHILE THE PROPYLENE ROPE WAS BEING CONTROLLED WITH HIS HANDS CREATING FRICTION BETWEEN THE TWO MATERIALS. THE GLOVES' MATERIAL (LEATHER) IN CONTACT WITH THE ROPE (POLYPROPYLENE) GAVE RISE TO ACCUMULATIONS OF ELECTRIC CHARGE THAT WAS RELEASED SUDDENLY IN ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGES WITH SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO IGNITE THE FLAMMABLE GAS MIX PRESENT AT THE PUMP NOTCH.

INFORMATION INDICATES THE CAUSE OF THE FLASH FIRE WAS A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF A FUEL RUN REGULATOR LOCATED ON THE VAPORIZER TRAILER. THE REGULATOR FAILURE CAUSED MULTIPLE RELIEF VALVES TO EXHAUST GAS TO THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS IGNITED BY THE WATER/GLYCOL HEATER BURNERS LOCATED ON THE VAPORIZER TRAILER. TWO EMPLOYEES WERE EXAMINED AT A NEARBY HOSPITAL AND RELEASED BACK TO FULL DUTY. THEY BOTH HAD SUNBURN LIKE INJURIES.    NORTHERN HAD PLACED THIS TEMPORARY / PORTABLE LNG TANKER AND VAPORIZER TAILER AT THE BENSON, MINNESOTA TOWN BORDER STATION AS A CONTINGENCY WHILE WORK WAS BEING CONDUCTED UPSTREAM AT THE ALEXANDRIA, MINNESOTA COMPRESSOR STATION. THE TANKER AND VAPORIZER HAD BEEN CONNECTED TO THE BENSON TOWN BORDER STATION SINCE 12/27/2013 BUT WASN'T IN-SERVICE UNTIL THE MORNING OF 12/31/2013. THE WATER BATH HEATERS ON THE VAPORIZER TRAILER WERE LIT BUT LNG WAS NOT BEING DELIVERED. ON 12/31/2013, THE PIPELINE GAS PRESSURE WAS LOW ENOUGH TO TEST THE LNG DELIVERY. THE DELIVERY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO COME ON WHEN THE REGULATOR FAILED AND THE FLASH FIRE OCCURRED. THE TOWN OF BENSON, MINNESOTA WAS NEVER IN DANGER OF LOSING NATURAL GAS SERVICE."

THE PLANT WAS OPERATING IN LIQUEFACTION MODE AND EXPERIENCED AN UNPLANNED SHUTDOWN OF ITS LIQUEFACTION PROCESS.  ON-SITE PERSONNEL RESPONDED APPROPRIATELY AND RETURNED THE PLANT TO HOLD MODE AND VERIFIED SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE WAS A SMALL CYCLING RELEASE OF CO2 FROM A VESSEL THROUGH ITS RELIEF VALVE FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 20 MINUTES.  FURTHER RESEARCH OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS CONFIRMED THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVENT AS THE FAILURE OF AN ALLEN-BRADLEY PLC-5/40E PROCESSOR BOARD.  THIS PLC WAS PROGRAMMED AS THE CONTROL PLC FOR THE PLANT LIQUEFACTION PROCESS.  A REPLACEMENT PLC WAS PROCURED AND DELIVERED TO THE PLANT ON WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 7, 2012.  THE LIQUEFACTION PLC PROGRAM WAS RELOADED INTO THE NEW PROCESSOR AND ITS FUNCTIONALITY WAS VERIFIED THAT SAME DAY.  THE PLANT WAS DECLARED BACK IN SERVICE BY NOON WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 7, 2012."

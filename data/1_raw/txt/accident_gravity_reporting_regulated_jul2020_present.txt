THE OPERATOR THEN DISPATCHED A VAC TRUCK TO LOCATION TO REMOVE THE FREE-STANDING CRUDE, APPROXIMATELY 45 BARRELS WERE RECOVERED BY THE VAC TRUCK.

THE CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM ALL AREAS, EXCEPT FOR A SMALL AREA AROUND THE STATION THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING HAND DUG AND SOIL BEING PARTIALLY REMOVED AND PARTIALLY TREATED ON-SITE.

TO MITIGATE THE SAME TYPE OF FAILURE IRONWOOD TOOK A TWO-STEP APPROACH; 1. THE LOW SUCTION SHUT-DOWN ALARM WAS ADJUSTED TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF A DETRIMENTAL LOW FLOW CONDITION, 2.

OPERATOR ARRIVED ON-SITE AND OBSERVED APPROXIMATELY 5 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED TO THE GROUND. THE RELEASE ORIGINATED FROM A 1-INCH THREADED DRAIN VALVE AND A 3/8-INCH TUBING LINE DISCONNECTING FROM THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, AND THE SITE WAS CLEANED UP AND REPAIRED PROMPTLY. INVESTIGATION FINDINGS INDICATE THE 3/8-INCH TUBING LINE WAS NOT INSTALLED CORRECTLY CAUSING IT TO DISCONNECT FROM THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER.  IT IS SUSPECTED THE TUBING INSERTION DEPTH INTO THE FEMALE NPT FITTING WAS INADEQUATE OR MISALIGNED PRIOR TO COMMISSIONING. THIS RESULTED IN THE TUBING LINE SHEARING INSIDE THE COMPRESSION FITTING, CAUSING IT TO DISCONNECT FROM THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER, LEADING TO THE RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL. THE 1-INCH THREADED DRAIN VALVE WAS A VERY MINOR SOURCE OF THE RELEASE. THE GUARDIAN PEAK INJECTION PUMP SKID DESIGN DOCUMENTS SPECIFIED THE USE OF SINGLE-PIECE CONSTRUCTION BALL VALVES TO BE INSTALLED AS VENTS AND DRAINS. THE SKID WAS DELIVERED WITH THREE-PIECE THREADED BALL VALVES INSTEAD. THE 1-INCH THREADED DRAIN VALVE DISPLAYED EARLY SIGNS OF FAILURE WHEN IT EXPERIENCED A SMALL LEAK ON THE SUCTION SIDE OF THE VALVE. TO PREVENT REOCCURRENCE, THE 3/8-INCH TUBING LINE WAS REMOVED FROM THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER, AND THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER WAS INSTALLED ON TOP OF THE PIPE. DELEK HAS REPLACED TWENTY-THREE (23) 1-INCH THREADED BALL VALVES WITH NEW SINGLE-PIECE CONSTRUCTION BALL VALVES. ADDITIONALLY, DELEK WILL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT TRAINING THAT INCLUDES THE REQUIREMENT TO DETACH PROCESS TUBING AND INSPECT FITTINGS AND INSERTION DEPTH ON UNITS PRIOR TO COMMISSIONING."

CPL'S INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THAT CROSS THREADING OCCURRED WHEN THE NUT WAS THREADED ONTO THE UNION BODY. THERE WAS VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE THREADS ON THE MALE END OF THE BODY INDICATING THAT CROSS THREADING OCCURRED DUE TO MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE NUT AND THE BODY WHEN ASSEMBLED TOGETHER. THIS PREVENTED THE NUT FROM FULLY SEALING THE TWO PARTS TOGETHER, ALLOWING THE FLUID TO LEAK OUT OF THE UNION WHERE THE TWO BODIES SEAT TOGETHER. THE UNION BODY WAS REPLACED ON DECEMBER 30, 2022 AND NO FURTHER ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED."

THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL INCLUDE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AND ASSOCIATED P&M MEASURES.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED ON AUGUST 5, 2022:  PART C-1.A. HAS BEEN UPDATED FROM ""8"" TO ""10"" TO REFLECT THE CORRECT DIAMETER OF THE STATION PIPING. THE PREVIOUSLY NARRATIVE MENTIONED A WELD OF 8'' TO A 4'' NIPPLE INCORRECTLY AND SHOULD HAVE REFLECTED 10''.    DURING THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, CPL ASSET INTEGRITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT THE PIPING CONFIGURATION CONSISTING OF A 4"" O-LET, NIPPLE, AND BLIND-FLANGE CONNECTED TO 10"" STATION PIPING CAUSED A STAGNANT ZONE ALLOWING THE OCCURRENCE OF INTERNAL CORROSION. THE INTERNAL CORROSION WITHIN THE STAGNANT ZONE RESULTED IN AN ISOLATED, THROUGH-WALL CORROSION PIT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION. CORROSION MITIGATION CHEMICAL TREATMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO TREAT PIPE WITH FLOW. HOWEVER, THE FAILURE OCCURRED IN A STAGNANT ZONE CAUSED BY A PIPING CONFIGURATION AND ANY TREATED OIL FLOWING THROUGH THE STATION PIPING WOULD NOT  PROVIDE PROTECTION. TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF REOCCURRENCE, THE PIPING CONFIGURATION WAS MODIFIED DURING THE PERMANENT REPAIR. BASED ON THE RECONFIGURATION, NO FURTHER ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED."

AT 3:00 AM SCM CRUDE OPERATIONS ARRIVED ON LOCATION AND CONFIRMED DISCOVERY OF THE CRUDE OIL SPILL. THE TOTAL VOLUME OF THE SPILL WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS:10 GALLONS ON THE SKID AND 10 GALLONS ON THE GROUND.   THE SOURCE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE AIR ELIMINATOR. THE LACT WAS SHUT DOWN, AND THE AIR ELIMINATOR WAS SUFFICIENTLY ISOLATED. BERMS AND ABSORBENTS CONTAINED THE SPILL TO A SMALL AREA. THE LACT WAS RESTARTED AT 4:00 AM. REMEDIATION OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL BEGAN AT 8:00 AM ON 01/31/2022. SOIL WAS EXCAVATED OFF SITE, AERATED, AND MIXED WITH FRESH SOIL, THEN PUT BACK IN PLACE. SOIL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND SENT OFF FOR ANALYSIS. LABORATORY ANALYTICAL RESULTS FROM THE CONFIRMATION SAMPLES INDICATE TPH AND BTEX CONCENTRATIONS DO NOT EXCEED NMOCD REMEDIATION GUIDELINES.   SCM'S INTERNAL INVESTIGATION RESULTS DETERMINED THAT THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE SPILL WAS THAT THE AIR ELIMINATOR FAILED AND CAUSED THE SUMP TO OVERFILL. DUE TO COLD AIR TEMPERATURES ON THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT, CRUDE OIL MOST LIKELY COAGULATED WITHIN THE DEVICE, CAUSING THE FLOAT TO STICK AND NOT DISCHARGE PROPERLY. SCM'S CORRECTIVE ACTION TO MITIGATE RECURRENCE OF AIR ELIMINATOR FAILURE IS TO SHUT THE DEVICES DURING THE WINTER MONTHS."

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK IN CPL'S SEMINOLE STATION LOCATED NEAR SEMINOLE IN GAINES COUNTY, TEXAS. THE CPL EMPLOYEE DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS ON THE 6'' BYPASS LINE FOR A METER SKID. THE METER SKID WAS ISOLATED AND THE BYPASS LINE WAS TEMPORARILY REMOVED WHILE WAITING FOR PERMANENT REPAIRS. FIVE (5) BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED AND RECOVERED DURING THE PROCESS. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT. CPL'S INVESTIGATION IS STILL PENDING AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL FOLLOW UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION. THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL INCLUDE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AND ASSOCIATED P&M MEASURES.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED ON JANUARY 11, 2022:  CPL'S DETAILED INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT UNDER-DEPOSIT CORROSION RESULTED IN A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT IN THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE WEST SEMINOLE TO SEMINOLE METER SKID 6"" BYPASS PIPING. THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE: THE ABSENCE OF A VALVE TO ISOLATE THE BYPASS DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS, STAGNANT CONDITIONS, AND WATER AND SOLIDS DEPOSITS AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE BYPASS. CPL OPERATIONS REPORTED THAT THE VALVE ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE 6"" BYPASS REMAINED CLOSED DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS AS IS REQUIRED TO MEASURE THE FLOW OF PRODUCT THROUGH THE CORIOLIS METER, AND NO VALVE EXISTS ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE BYPASS PIPING. THE ABSENCE OF A VALVE ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE METER SKID 6"" BYPASS PIPING PREVENTED ISOLATION OF THE BYPASS DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF A VALVE ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE METER SKID, THE BYPASS FILLED WITH CRUDE OIL AND STAGNANT CONDITIONS OCCURRED DURING OPERATION. STAGNANT CONDITIONS ALLOWED WATER AND SOLIDS TO DEPOSIT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE BYPASS, AND THE CORROSION RATE INCREASED UNDER THE SOLIDS DEPOSIT. THE PARAFFIN DEPOSITS PREVENTED THE CORROSION MITIGATION CHEMICALS FROM REACHING THE STEEL SURFACE, THEREBY PREVENTING THE NORMAL ACTION OF THE CHEMICALS. CPL DETERMINES THAT UNDER-DEPOSIT CORROSION RESULTED IN A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT IN THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE WEST SEMINOLE TO SEMINOLE METER SKID 6"" BYPASS PIPING. IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THIS CORROSION ON THE STATION PIPING WAS NOT RELATED TO THE CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF THE CRUDE OIL OR TO ANY UNEXPECTED CORROSIVENESS OF THE CRUDE OIL. RECORDS SHOW THAT THE CRUDE OIL WAS UNIFORMLY TREATED WITH CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS AND BIOCIDES, BUT THE INCIDENT INSPECTION AND LAB ANALYSIS PROVED THAT THE CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS WERE PREVENTED FROM REACHING THE BIOFILM BY A LAYER OF WAXY PARAFFIN.    IN ORDER TO PREVENT RECURRENCE, CPL EVALUATED THE NON-REGULATED, GATHERING METER BYPASS PIPING AND DETERMINED THAT CURRENT OPERATIONS DID NOT SUPPORT A PERMANENT REPLACEMENT. CPL PERMANENTLY REMOVED THE METER BYPASS PIPING."

CPL DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE THE DORA ROBERT WARSAN FIELD PIG LAUNCHER BYPASS AND IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE LEAK. HOWEVER, 0.83 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.    THE ASSOCIATED PIPING IS CLASSIFIED AS A ""REPORTING REGULATED-ONLY GATHERING LINE."" CPL'S REPAIRS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND THE INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY. SAMPLES HAVE BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY. FOLLOWING RETURN OF THE RESULTS AND THE INVESTIGATION, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL FOLLOW.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED ON DECEMBER 16, 2021:  THE COST HAS BEEN UPDATED AND THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION INCIDENT NUMBER IS 2533.    CPL'S ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT INCORRECT OPERATIONS CAUSED THE INTERNAL CORROSION LEAK ON THE DORA ROBERTS TRUNK B (WARSAN) PIG LAUNCHER BYPASS PIPING. CPL PROCEDURES REQUIRE THE BYPASS VALVE BE RETURNED TO THE NORMAL OPEN POSITION AFTER LAUNCHING THE MAINTENANCE PIG. THE STAGNANT CONDITIONS OCCURRING IN THE LAUNCHER BYPASS ARE DUE TO THE BYPASS VALVE REMAINING CLOSED DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS. WITH NO PRODUCT FLOWING THROUGH THE LAUNCHER BYPASS, ACCUMULATION OF WATER AND SOLIDS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASED CORROSION RATE. THE SOLIDS DEPOSITS CAUSED A GALVANIC COUPLE BETWEEN THE DEPOSITS AND THE STEEL PIPE. THE SOLID DEPOSITS PREVENTED THE CORROSION MITIGATION CHEMICALS FROM REACHING THE STEEL SURFACE, THEREBY PREVENTING THE NORMAL ACTION OF THE CHEMICALS.    AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT RETRAINING ON THE 'LAUNCHING AND RECEIVING SCRAPER' PROCEDURAL STEPS WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE OPERATING AREA. REPAIRS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND NO FURTHER P&M MEASURES ARE NEEDED.     SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED ON JANUARY 03, 2022:  UPDATED PART A. 12.A.

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK IN CPL'S FLANAGAN STATION NEAR SEMINOLE, TEXAS IN GAINES COUNTY, TEXAS. CPL DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE THE FLANAGAN PUMP HEAD GASKET AND IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE LEAK. HOWEVER, 0.2 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.    CPL'S DETAILED INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT A MISSING COTTER KEY ALLOWED THE JAM NUT THAT SECURES THE LIQUID END PISTON TO LOOSEN AND CONTACT THE HEAD WHICH RESULTED IN GASKET FAILURE. THE JAM NUT BACKED OUT FAR ENOUGH TO PRESS ON THE HEAD CAUSING THE GASKET TO FAIL AND ALLOWED OIL TO LEAK FROM THE FLUID END OF THE PUMP. CPL FOUND THAT THE PISTON ROD ASSEMBLY OF THE REFURBISHED FLANAGAN PUMP HAS NOT BEEN DISASSEMBLED PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. ADDITIONALLY, SIMILAR PUMPS FROM THE SAME PUMP SUPPLIER, IEQ INDUSTRIES LTD (IEQ), HAVE SHOWN POOR QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP DURING SERVICE, AND AS SUCH, DOES NOT ALIGN WITH OUR COMMITMENT TO SAFETY.

TESTS ARE BEING PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF A LONG TERM REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED AND IF SO, THEY WILL BE NOTED ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT. : UPDATE 4/23/2021 - NO LONG TERM  REMEDIATION NEEDED, SOIL REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON THE SITE.     AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE AND PLAN TO PREVENT REOCCURRENCE ARE ALSO BEING PERFORMED AND RESULTS WILL BE SUBMITTED ON A FUTURE  SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT. :UPDATE 4/23/2021 THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EQUIPMENT FAILURE WAS ""TEMPERATURE EXTREMES"", ON THE DATE OF THE RELEASE TEXAS WAS EXPERIENCING WINTER STORM URI AND ASSOCIATED FREEZING TEMPERATURES. THE FAILED COMPONENT WAS A GARLOCK FIBER GASKET LOCATED IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM OF A ISOLATION VALVE THAT CLOSES WHEN PNEUMATIC  SUPPLY GAS PRESSURE DROPS BELOW 80PSI. THE EFFECTS OF PROLONGED, UNUSUALLY COLD TEMPERATURES ON THE SUPPLY GAS LINE TO THE ISOLATION VALVE CAUSED THE ISOLATION VALVE TO CLOSE UNEXPECTEDLY, WHILE THE SYSTEMS POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMP CONTINUED TO OPERATE LEADING TO EVENTUAL GASKET FAILURE.     TO PREVENT REOCCURRENCE CAMINO REAL HAS ADDED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR PUMP SHUTDOWN WHEN THE ISOLATION VALVE GOES CLOSED, REPLACED THE FIBER GASKET WITH A FLEXITALLIC / SPIRAL WOUND GASKET,  AND EVALUATED OTHER CAMINO REAL GATHERING SITES FOR SIMILAR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE AND CORRECTED IF NEEDED."

FIELD PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED AND THE LINE WAS SHUT DOWN.  WHEN PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE, THEY IDENTIFIED A CRACKED FITTING ON A PIECE OF THREADED PIPE.    THE INITIAL FIELD INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THERE WAS A HOSE CONNECTED TO A PRESSURE TRANSMITTER FROM A CONTROL VALVE WHICH HAD FROZEN IN THE EXTREME COLD.  THIS FROZEN HOSE THEN CAUSED THE CONTROL VALVE TO CLOSE ERRONEOUSLY.  THE CONTROL VALVE CLOSURE SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSED LINE PRESSURE TO RELIEVE TO THE RELIEF TANKS ON SITE.  THE CHATTERING OF THE RELIEF VALVE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CREATED EXCESSIVE VIBRATION, WHICH COMBINED WITH THE EXTREMELY COLD TEMPERATURES, LED TO THE FAILURE OF A THREADED PIPE NIPPLE.  THE FAILURE OF THE THREADED FITTING RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY 5 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL BEING RELEASED INTO THE CONTAINMENT AREA SURROUNDING THE EQUIPMENT.

THE AIR PATROL PILOT NOTIFIED CENTURION PIPELINE L.P. (CPL), AND CPL IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A COMPANY EMPLOYEE TO THE LOCATION. ON JANUARY 4, 2021, AT APPROXIMATELY 12:50 CST, CPL RESOURCES ARRIVED ON-SITE AND DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE THE FORBES TO SOUTHLAND 3'' PIPELINE. CPL PROMPTLY ISOLATED THE LEAK AND BEGAN CLEAN UP EFFORTS. HOWEVER, 20 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED. CPL RECOVERED 15 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL IN LIQUID FORM AND REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.    AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING, THE PERMANENT REPAIR OF THE PIPELINE SEGMENT IS SCHEDULED AND THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED PENDING THE REMOVAL OF THE DAMAGED PIPE. THE REPLACEMENT PIPE HAS BEEN FABRICATED, SCHEDULED FOR HYDRO, AND INSTALLATION SCHEDULED FOR THE 2ND WEEK OF FEBRUARY. THE RESULTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING THE PIPELINE WILL BE SUBMITTED VIA SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT(S).    SUPPLEMENTAL FILED ON 03/10/2021:  UPDATED PART A4, D6A, AND D6C. DURING THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, CPL IDENTIFIED THE LEAK AS EXTERNAL CORROSION CAUSED BY DISBONDED COATING WHICH SHIELDED THE PIPELINE FROM CATHODIC PROTECTION AND ALLOWED A CORROSION CELL TO FORM. UPON EXCAVATION, CPL DISCOVERED THE POORLY ADHERED COAL TAR COATING, CAUSED BY AGE AND SOIL STRESS, EXTENDED BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE LEAK LOCATION. CPL REPLACED 700 FEET OF PIPE AFFECTED BY THE DISBONDED COATING AND BELIEVES THE PIPE REPLACEMENT WILL PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS."

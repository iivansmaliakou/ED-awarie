AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, KANAWHA COUNTY WAS EXPERIENCING SEVERE FLASH FLOODING SPECIFICALLY IN AREAS NEAR SLAUGHTERS CREEK AND A STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS DECLARED BY THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA ON 8/28/23. GAS CONTROL RECEIVED INITIAL NOTIFICATION OF THIS INCIDENT ON 8/28/23 AT APPROXIMATELY 08:00 BASED ON A PRESSURE DROP AT CORNWELL COMPRESSOR STATION (WHICH IS UPSTREAM OF WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON TL-263) AS INDICATED BY THE SCADA SYSTEM. GAS CONTROL HAD EARLIER BEEN NOTIFIED BY DIVERSIFIED ENERGY AT APPROXIMATELY 06:30 THAT A PIPELINE OPERATED BY DIVERSIFIED ENERGY THAT IS CONNECTED TO TL-263 AT SLAUGHTERS CREEK M&R (WHICH IS LOCATED IN PROXIMITY TO SLAUGHTERS CREEK) HAD ALSO EXPERIENCED A PRESSURE DROP AND IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT THE PIPELINE OPERATED BY DIVERSIFIED ENERGY EXPERIENCED A FULL GUILLOTINE BREAK AS A RESULT OF THE SEVERE FLASH FLOODING. THAT FULL GUILLOTINE BREAK OCCURRED AT A POINT IN TIME BEFORE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON TL-263. TL-263 IS A TYPE R (REGULATORY REPORTING) GATHERING PIPELINE AND HAS A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE OF 274 PSIG. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE OPERATING PRESSURE ON TL-263 WAS 240 PSIG AND TL-263 WAS FLOWING GAS. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE PREVENTED BY LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCESS CERTAIN ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES (INCLUDING SLAUGHTERS CREEK M&R) ASSOCIATED WITH TL-263 BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE FLASH FLOODING. WHEN IT WAS SAFE TO DO SO, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL BEGAN ISOLATING THE SECTION OF TL-263 CONTAINING SLAUGHTERS CREEK M&R. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVE N AT CHELYAN COMPRESSOR STATION AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 WHICH IS UPSTREAM OF WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON TL-263 AND CONNECTS TL-263 TO TL-570. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVE D AT LOUP CREEK COMPRESSOR STATION AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM WHICH IS DOWNSTREAM OF WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON TL-263 AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE FEED ON TL-263 FROM EASTERN AMERICAN ENERGY AT EASTERN AMERICAN GATE. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON TL-263 AT APPROXIMATELY 15:00 AT WHICH POINT IT WAS REALIZED THAT TL-263 HAD SUFFERED A FULL GUILLOTINE BREAK AT THE ABOVEGROUND CROSSING OF SLAUGHTERS CREEK. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS CAUSED BY FLOATING DEBRIS THAT WAS ADRIFT AS A RESULT OF THE SEVERE FLASH FLOODING. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVE A AT THE WHITE OAKS RECEIVER AT APPROXIMATELY 17:00 WHICH IS DOWNSTREAM OF WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON TL-263 AND UPSTREAM OF VALVE D AT LOUP CREEK COMPRESSOR STATION AND THE FEED ON TL-263 FROM EASTERN AMERICAN ENERGY AT EASTERN AMERICAN GATE. THE CLOSURE OF VALVE A AT THE WHITE OAKS RECEIVER COMPLETED THE ISOLATION OF THE SECTION OF TL-263 CONTAINING THE INCIDENT. INITIAL TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER ON 8/28/23 AT 20:49. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER ASSIGNED INCIDENT REPORT #1377546 TO THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION OF THE INCIDENT. A FOLLOW UP TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER ON 8/30/23 AT 17:30 TO CONFIRM THE INITIAL TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION AND UPDATE THE VOLUME OF UNINTENTIONAL GAS LOSS. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER ASSIGNED INCIDENT REPORT #1377726 TO THE FOLLOW UP TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION. THE FOLLOWING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WERE COMPLETED: THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF TL-263 WAS PATROLLED VIA HELICOPTER WHEN WEATHER CONDITIONS ALLOWED ON 8/30/23, THE SECTION OF TL-263 WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED WAS CAPPED OFF, AND FLOW WAS RESUMED ON TL-263 VIA THE CONNECTION BETWEEN TL-263 AND TL-570 AT BLACK EAGLE JUNCTION WHICH IS DOWNSTREAM OF WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON TL-263 BUT UPSTREAM OF VALVE A AT THE WHITE OAKS RECEIVER. FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE REMEDIAL ACTIONS, TL-263 WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 9/15/23 AT 05:48."

ON MARCH 29, 2023, TALLGRASS REASONABLY BELIEVED THAT THE VOLUME OF THE GAS RELEASED EXCEEDED THE 3 MILLION CUBIC FEET THRESHOLD AND SUBSEQUENTLY, TELEPHONICALLY NOTIFIED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC). THE INITIAL NRC REPORT HAD THE INCORRECT UNIT FOR THE VOLUME NOTED; THE VOLUME WAS REPORTED IN CUBIC FEET, NOT IN THE MILLION CUBIC FEET. A CORRECTION WAS MADE TO THE INITIAL NRC ON MARCH 30, 2023, AND THE REVISED VOLUME CONTAINED HEREIN WAS REPORTED ON MARCH 31, 2023.     INITIALLY, THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED VIA CUTOUT AND REPLACEMENT AND PLACED BACK IN OPERATION ON MARCH 31, 2023.

THE PIPELINE MOST LIKELY FAILED DUE TO OVERPRESSURE EVENT.   PRESSURE DATA AVAILABLE FOR THE SYSTEM INDICATES THE PIPELINE NORMALLY OPERATES AT APPROXIMATELY 30-100 PSIG.  A PRESSURE TRANSMITTER IN THE VICINITY RECORDED APPROXIMATELY 208 PSIG DUE TO A WELL COMING ONLINE AND A PRESSURE REGULATOR FAILING. (   THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY A PRESSURE REGULATOR MALFUNCTION AT ONE OF THE NEARBY WELLS SUPPLYING GAS TO THE PIPELINE. TO PREVENT SIMILAR EVENTS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE, TALLGRASS IS TAKING THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  1. INSPECT OVERPRESSURE PREVENTION EQUIPMENT AT LEAST ONCE EACH CALENDAR YEAR, NOT TO EXCEED 15 MONTHS."

A SECOND LEAK WAS NOTED IN THE SAME VICINITY OF THE ORIGINAL RELEASE AND IT IS SUSPECTED THAT BOTH RELEASES OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY, AS PART OF THE SAME INCIDENT.     GAS LOSS REPORTED IN THE INITIAL REPORT ACCOUNTS FOR GAS RELEASED FROM RUPTURE UNTIL INITIAL VALVE CLOSURE, APPROXIMATELY 2.5 HOURS.  GAS CONTINUED TO RELEASE AT A LOWER LEVEL UNTIL STOPPLES WERE USED TO ISOLATE THE LEAK FULLY.  THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GAS LOSS INFORMATION TO ACCOUNT FOR GAS RELEASED BETWEEN INITIAL VALVE CLOSURE AND FULL ISOLATION USING STOPPLE FITTINGS.    A CAUSE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING AND A PROJECT TO REPAIR THE LINE IS UNDERWAY.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT UPDATE: BECAUSE BOTH THE INITIAL LEAK/RUPTURE AND THE SECOND LEAK WERE RELATIVELY CLOSE IN GEOGRAPHY, DEO INITIALLY BELIEVED THAT BOTH LEAKS OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY.  THE SECOND LEAK WAS DISCOVERED WHEN EMPLOYEES WERE WALKING THE LINE IN THE AREA IN PREPARATION FOR THE REPAIR WORK AND SMELLED AN ODOR OF GAS.    HOWEVER, UPON EXCAVATION, PERSONNEL ON SITE NOTED A DISCOLORATION OF THE SOIL SURROUNDING THE SECOND LEAK, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT WHAT DEO IS CALLING THE SECOND LEAK MAY HAVE OCCURRED AT SOME TIME PRIOR TO THE INITIAL LEAK/RUPTURE. AS THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL UNDERWAY, ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE CAUSE FOR THE INITIAL RUPTURE AND THE CAUSE AND TIMING FOR THE SECOND LEAK ARE UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME.  DEO WILL SUPPLEMENT THIS INFORMATION IN A FUTURE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.    5/16/23 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT UPDATE: LAB EXAMINATION IS BEING SCHEDULED AND DEO WILL SUPPLEMENT THIS REPORT ONCE IT IS COMPLETED.    6/8/23 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT UPDATE: LAB EXAMINATION IS SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 26 AND 27, 2023.

DURING THE WORK ACTIVITIES AN INCIDENT OCCURRED RESULTING IN ONE FATALITY OF A NEXUS EMPLOYEE AND INJURING TWO OTHER NEXUS EMPLOYEES. TARGA'S PIPELINE WAS DAMAGED DURING THE EVENT. ONE TARGA EMPLOYEE AND ONE ENTERPRISE EMPLOYEE WERE ON LOCATION WHEN THE EVENT OCCURRED.    NEXUS WAS HIRED TO INSTALL TEST LEADS CONNECTING TWO ENTERPRISE PIPELINES TO TWO TARGA PIPELINES (ONE EIGHT-INCH PIPELINE AND ONE FOUR-INCH PIPELINE) WITHIN A RIGHT-OF-WAY LOCATED AT 28.736804, -99.008283 AFTER TARGA IDENTIFIED STRAY CURRENT NORTH OF THE FOUR-INCH PIPELINE DURING A CATHODIC PROTECTION SURVEY. TARGA ACQUIRED BOTH PIPELINES IN APRIL OF 2022 AND THE PRIOR OPERATOR LISTED THE PIPELINE MATERIAL FOR BOTH PIPELINES AS STEEL IN ITS GIS DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED TO TARGA.   PRIOR TO STARTING PROJECT WORK, NEXUS SUBMITTED A LINE LOCATING REQUEST WITH 811 (TICKET #2352321781). PROJECT WORK BEGAN ON JANUARY 30, 2023 AT THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT. ON THAT DAY, NEXUS HYDRO-VACUUM EXCAVATED 12"" X 12"" HOLES TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY BOTH ENTERPRISE AND BOTH TARGA PIPELINES. NEXUS NEXT WORKED ON THE ENTERPRISE PIPELINES.   ON JANUARY 31, 2023, AT THE SAME LOCATION, NEXUS PLANNED TO INSTALL A TEST LEAD WIRE TO TARGA'S FOUR-INCH PIPELINE THROUGH THE 12"" X 12"" HOLE CREATED ON JANUARY 30, 2023. NEXUS PLANNED TO SAND COATING FROM THE PIPELINE USING A PNEUMATIC SANDER ATTACHED TO AN EXTENSION DEVICE, AND THEN, TO CAD-WELD A TEST LEAD WIRE TO THE TOP OF THE PIPE. BASED ON THE GIS DATA ACQUIRED FROM THE PRIOR OPERATOR, VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE PIPELINE, AND OTHER TESTING, TARGA PERSONNEL CONCLUDED THAT THE PIPELINE WAS STEEL COATED IN FUSION BONDED EPOXY, WHICH IS SIMILAR IN COLOR TO THE MANUFACTURED COLOR OF FIBERSPAR OUTER JACKET AND RESEMBLES FBE COATING. NEXUS SANDED ON THE PIPELINE FOR APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR AND THEN NEXUS INFORMED TARGA THAT IT WAS GOING TO FURTHER EXCAVATE BY HYDROVAC TO GAIN BETTER ACCESS TO THE PIPELINE. AFTER THE INCIDENT, NEXUS INFORMED TARGA THAT IT HAD RETURNED TO SANDING THE PIPELINE AND THE RELEASE OCCURRED.   TARGA'S POST-INCIDENT INVESTIGATION DETERMINED: THE FOUR-INCH PIPELINE WAS FIBERSPAR (COMPOSITE); THE OUTER COLOR OF THE PIPELINE WAS SIMILAR TO FUSION BONDED EPOXY; THE PIPELINE WAS NOT INSTALLED WITH A TRACER WIRE; THE GIS DATA FROM THE PRIOR OPERATOR HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED AS TO THE PIPELINE MATERIAL; NEXUS DID NOT USE ANY EQUIPMENT, TOOLS, PROCEDURES, OR OTHER METHOD TO VERIFY THE PIPELINE COMPOSITION BEFORE STARTING WORK; AND NEXUS SANDED ON THE PIPELINE FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR AND CONTINUED SANDING WITHOUT EXCAVATING FOR BETTER ACCESS TO THE PIPELINE."

THE LOCAL LEL MONITOR DETECTED FLAMMABLE NATURAL GAS, ALARMED AND BOTH THE LEL AND FIRE EYE SHUTDOWN THE UNIT (E.G. ESD). TWO OPERATORS (INCLUDES CONTRACT OPERATOR) WERE ONSITE AND NOTICED THE FIRE WITHIN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING AND ONE OF THE OPERATORS HIT THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) FOR THE SITE. THE OPERATORS SAFELY EVACUATED SITE TO A SAFE MUSTER POINT. AT APPROXIMATELY 20:36, SUPERVISORS/MANAGEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS WERE NOTIFIED OF THE EVENTS. THE THUNDER CREEK GAS SERVICE (TCGS) OPERATOR ONSITE SERVED AS INCIDENT COMMAND (IC) UNTIL THE CAMPBELL COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT AND TCGS FIELD MANAGEMENT ARRIVED ONSITE AT 21:23 AND 21:28, RESPECTIVELY. THE IC TEAM DETERMINED THAT THE TCGS PERSONNEL COULD SAFELY ENTER THE LOCATION TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE UNIT TO STARVE THE SMALL RESIDUAL FLAMES OF FLAMMABLE GAS. THE TCGS TEAM USED A FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO SAFELY PUT OUT A SMALL FLAME. THE CAMPBELL COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT DETERMINED THAT NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE OR OVERSIGHT WAS NEEDED AND WAS RELEASED AT 22:15. THE TCGS SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED ONSITE AT 22:58 AND ASSISTED WITH A COMPLETE SITE WALKDOWN TO ENSURE SAFETY WITH TCGS PERSONNEL. THIS WALKDOWN INCLUDED ASSESSING ALL OTHER COMPRESSOR PACKAGES ONSITE TO DETERMINE IF THEY WERE SAFE FOR OPERATION.     THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A LIKELY FAILURE IN A PIPING COMPONENT DUE TO A FREEZE IN THE DRAIN LINE UNDER THE SUCTION SCRUBBER TO THE SCREW COMPRESSOR PACKAGE. OPERATING DATA INDICATES THAT UNIT AND COMPONENTS DID NOT EXCEED MAOP/MAWP. THE SUSPECTED FAILURE RESULTED IN A GAS LEAK WITHIN THE BUILDING AND THE LIKELY IGNITION SOURCE WAS THE TURBO ON THE ENGINE. AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT, THIS AREA WAS OPERATING AT ABOUT 15 PSIG OF PRESSURE. THE FIRE WAS CONFINED WITHIN THE SMALL BUILDING. THE CAUSE OF THE FREEZE WAS LIKELY DUE TO THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS EXPERIENCED IN THE REGION AT THE TIME. THIS STATION HAD ENCOUNTERED SIGNIFICANT DOWNTIME DUE TO LOW GAS VOLUMES FROM THE LOCAL PRODUCTION AREA. DURING THAT DOWNTIME, THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW ZERO.     IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EACH COMPRESSOR PACKAGE HAS AN INDIVIDUAL BUILDING. THIS INCIDENT DID NOT IMPACT OTHER UNITS, EQUIPMENT, OR PIPING OUTSIDE OF THE PACKAGE. AN INVESTIGATION AND ASSESSMENT TEAM WENT INTO THE UNIT IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS AFTER THE FIRE AND STARTED TO ASSESS ROOT CAUSE AND THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES. DURING THAT PROCESS, THE TEAM REALIZED THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT WAS DAMAGED AND WOULD NEED REPLACEMENT. ALSO, SOME PIPING COMPONENTS, DEVICES, AND BUILDING INSULATION/PANELS WOULD REQUIRE REPLACEMENT. ONCE THE TEAM DETERMINED THAT THE COST WOULD EXCEED THE ""INCIDENT REPORTING"" THRESHOLD, AN IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NRC, WITH A 48-HOUR FOLLOW-UP REPORT. TCGS PERSONNEL ALSO COMMUNICATED WITH THE WYOMING DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (WDEQ) AND THE WYOMING PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION."

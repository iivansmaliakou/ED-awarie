THREE (3.4) BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED AND RECOVERED DURING THE PROCESS. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT. CPL'S INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THAT CROSS THREADING OCCURRED WHEN THE NUT WAS THREADED ONTO THE UNION BODY. THERE WAS VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE THREADS ON THE MALE END OF THE BODY INDICATING THAT CROSS THREADING OCCURRED DUE TO MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE NUT AND THE BODY WHEN ASSEMBLED TOGETHER. THIS PREVENTED THE NUT FROM FULLY SEALING THE TWO PARTS TOGETHER, ALLOWING THE FLUID TO LEAK OUT OF THE UNION WHERE THE TWO BODIES SEAT TOGETHER.

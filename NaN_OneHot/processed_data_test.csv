PRIOR TO NOTIFYING EPIC THE THIRD-PARTY OPERATOR THOUGHT THE LEAK WAS ON THEIR SYSTEM AND MOBILIZED TO THE SITE AND BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE LEAK. AFTER INVESTIGATING THE LEAK MOST OF THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 20TH, THEY NOTIFIED EPIC THAT THEY HAD INVESTIGATED THEIR LINE AND DETERMINED THAT THEIR SYSTEM WAS NOT LEAKING AND THAT THE LEAK WAS ON EPIC'S PIPELINE SYSTEM. AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF A LEAK ON THE EPIC PIPELINE SYSTEM THROUGH SCADA. EPIC IMMEDIATELY MOBILIZED OPERATIONS PERSONNEL TO THE SITE AND BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE LEAK ORIGIN. EPIC SHUT IN THE PIPELINE SYSTEM AND ISOLATED THE SEGMENT WHERE THE LEAK WAS LOCATED. AS A RESULT OF THE LEAK INVESTIGATION EPIC DETERMINED ON FEBRUARY 21ST THAT THE LEAK WAS ON THEIR PIPELINE SYSTEM. A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO INSTALL STOPPLES AT A SAFE DISTANCE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE AFFECTED AREA, BLOW-DOWN THE SEGMENT, AND SAFELY EXCAVATE THE AREA TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF LEAK AND MAKE REPAIRS TO THE PIPELINE SYSTEM. AFTER THE SITE WAS EXCAVATED, A CRACK ON THE BOTTOM OF A GIRTH WELD WAS FOUND TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. EPIC CUT-OUT AND REPLACED THE SECTION OF PIPE WITH THE CRACK.   THE SECTION OF PIPE WITH THE CRACK WAS SENT TO A METALLURGICAL LABORATORY TO BE ANALYZED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE CRACK.   AN UPDATE WILL BE PROVIDED ONCE THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION EPIC WILL DETERMINE MITIGATION TO MINIMIZE FUTURE RE-OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS.   UPDATE:  UPON COMPLETION OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS EPIC HAS DETERMINED THE CAUSE WAS A CRACK IN A WELD REPAIR AREA OF THE GIRTH WELD. A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS BY A THIRD-PARTY LABORATORY DETERMINED THE ROOT CAUSE WAS CONTRIBUTED TO A BRITTLE FRACTURE DUE TO POOR TOUGHNESS PROPERTIES OF THE WELD METAL DEPOSITED IN THE ROOT REGION CONTAINING SLAG INCLUSIONS AS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE CRACKING IN THE WELD REPAIR. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS COULD ALSO INVOLVE A HIGH-LOW FIT-UP CONDITION AND HIGH WELD RESTRAINT DUE TO THE WELD BEING A TIE-IN WELD. THE WELD DISCONTINUITIES, SLAG INCLUSIONS, AND HIGH-LOW FIT-UP WERE NOT CONSIDERED DEFECTS OR REJECTABLE, AS THEY MET ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA PER API 1104, 20TH EDITION, SECTION 7.2 (ALIGNMENT) AND 9.3.8.1 (SLAG INCLUSIONS).   TO MITIGATE FUTURE RE-OCCURRENCE OF THE SAME TYPE OF FAILURE EPIC REVIEWED AND ANALYZED ALL THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINED THERE WERE MULTIPLE CHARACTERISTICS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE. THESE CHARACTERISTICS WERE THEN USED TO PERFORM A REVIEW OF EPIC'S SYSTEM TO DETERMINE IF THE POTENTIAL THREAT EXISTED AT OTHER SITES. THERE WERE NO OTHER SITES IDENTIFIED DURING THE REVIEW.",781.0,0.0,1440.0,72.84722222222221,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.11,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE HYDRO-TEST FOR THIS PIPELINE WAS TO BE CONDUCTED IN THREE SEGMENTS.  THE EAST-SIDE SEGMENT WAS COMPLETED ON APRIL 12TH AND WEST-SIDE SEGMENT WAS COMPLETED ON APRIL 13TH.  THE CENTER SEGMENT WOULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS.  DIFFERENT METHODS OF TRYING TO GET A GOOD HYDRO ON THE LINE WERE ATTEMPTED WITHOUT SUCCESS.      THE DECISION WAS MADE TO CONDUCT A UT SMART PIG ON THE PIPELINE ON APRIL 11TH, AND THE PROCESS TO AWARD THE CONTRACT WAS STARTED WITHIN CITGO PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS.  THE CONTRACT WAS AWARDED AND SIGNED ON MAY 6TH.  CONTRACT SURVEYORS MOBILIZED ON MAY 8TH AND THE SMART PIG WAS SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED ON MAY 13TH.  ON THE EVENING OF MAY 13TH, CITGO RECEIVED PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM THE PIGGING CONTRACTOR THAT INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF TWO UNDERGROUND FLANGES ON THIS PIPELINE (ONE AT THE 91 AREA AND ONE AT GATE 5 AREA).    ON MAY 18TH, CITGO STARTING HYDRO-EXCAVATING/POT-HOLING THE AREAS IN QUESTION IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE UNDERGROUND FLANGES FOR INSPECTION AND REMOVAL.  ON MAY 20TH, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ONE OF THE POTHOLES AT THE 91 AREA HAD DEVELOPED A LAYER OF DIESEL IN IT AT A DEPTH OF ~18 FEET BELOW GRADE.  WITH THE E05 PIPELINE OUT OF SERVICE FOR TESTING, THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AT THAT TIME.  HYDRO-EXCAVATION CONTINUED AT THE 91 AREA TO LOCATE THE UNDERGROUND FLANGES, WITH NONE OF THE OTHER POTHOLES INDICATING ANY SIGN OF DIESEL.  WHEN THE FLANGES WERE LOCATED AT BOTH LOCATIONS, LARGE EXCAVATIONS, UTILIZING HYDRO-EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES, WITH THE PROPER SHORING WERE INSTALLED FOR THE INSPECTION AND REMOVAL OF THE FLANGES.  OVER TIME, THE EXCAVATION AT THE 91 AREA WAS LEACHING IN DIESEL INTO THE SHORE BOX.  THIS MATERIAL WAS PUMPED OUT PERIODICALLY INTO FRAC TANKS FOR CONTAINMENT.    WITH THE FLANGES EXPOSED ON JUNE 10TH, A HYDRO-TEST WAS CONDUCTED AND INDICATED THAT THE FLANGE AT THE 91 AREA WAS LEAKING.  ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 10TH, NOTIFICATION OF ALL AGENCIES WAS CONDUCTED, WITH THE COAST GUARD AND TGLO MAKING A SITE VISIT THAT EVENING.  THE TCEQ AND RRCT CONTACTED US ON JUNE 11TH AND TCEQ ALSO VISITED THE SITE.    TWO DEWATERING WELLS AND A RECOVERY SUMP WERE INSTALLED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE EXCAVATION AT THE 91 AREA  TO LOWER THE GROUNDWATER TABLE AND PREVENT HYDROCARBON LEACHING INTO THE SHORE BOX.  THIS ALLOWED MAINTENANCE TO SAFELY ENTER THE SHORE BOX TO REMOVE THE UNDERGROUND FLANGES.  DELINEATION AND REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WILL BE PERFORMED PER THE TCEQ 30TAC SPILL RULES OR TEXAS RISK REDUCTION PROGRAM (TRRP-13) AS REQUIRED.    THE FLANGES AT THE GATE 5 AREA AND 91 AREA HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH PIPING SECTIONS.

THE SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:    - THE HOT TAP FITTING LEAKED AT THE TOE OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL FILLET WELD JOINING THE FITTING TO THE IN-SERVICE PIPE.    - THE LEAK WAS DUE TO A HYDROGEN CRACK AT THE TOE OF THE WELD.    - THE UNUSUALLY HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE IN-SERVICE PIPE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRACKING.    THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THE UNUSUALLY HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE IN-SERVICE PIPE AS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRACKING.  A REVIEW OF AVAILABLE RECORDS WAS COMPLETED FOLLOWING THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER SEGMENTS ON THE SOUTH MAIN LOOP LINE, WITH SAME VINTAGE OF PIPE AND TAPS, THAT MAY EXIST AND REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR MONITORING.

COLUMBIA'S SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED AT 12:42 AM AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT 01:15 AM AND FOUND THAT GAS HAD BEEN SHUT OFF AT THE METER VALVE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. ADDITIONAL COLUMBIA RESOURCES ARRIVED ON SITE AT 1:50 AM TO ASSIST IN THE RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT. COLUMBIA EMPLOYEES SET UP A PERIMETER AND EVACUATED THE NEIGHBORING HOME AT 605 FLEMING FALLS WHERE NATURAL GAS READINGS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE BASEMENT. COLUMBIA VERIFIED THAT THE SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS WITHIN THE MAOP ESTABLISHED FOR THAT SYSTEM AND THAT ODORANT WAS COMPLIANT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. ELECTRIC METERS WERE REMOVED TO ELIMINATE SOURCES OF IGNITION AND COLUMBIA BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR LEAKAGE AND ENSURE SAFETY.    THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAIN  THAT CAUSED THE SANITARY LIFT PUMPS TO FAIL  AND MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY PUSHED A SLUG OF SEWER GAS  INTO THE BASEMENT VIA FLOOR DRAINS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE TIED DIRECTLY TO THE SANITARY SEWER FOR 605 AND 613 FLEMING FALLS RD. THE EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED APPEARS TO BE A LOW LEVEL EXPLOSION. COLUMBIA LOCATED AND REPAIRED A TOTAL OF FOUR LEAKS OF WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE NON-CAUSAL. THE CLOSEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 290' AWAY AND THE FURTHEST BEING APPROXIMATELY 1300' AWAY FROM THE INCIDENT. THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET IS APPROXIMATELY 12'  LOWER THAN THE SURFACE LEVEL OF THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE INCIDENT SITE.  COLUMBIA CREATED A TEMPORARY BYPASS TO KEEP CUSTOMERS IN SERVICE, ABANDONING APPROXIMATELY 775' OF BARE STEEL HIGH PRESSURE MAINLINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET.    COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE BARE STEEL MAIN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STREET ALONG WITH THE SERVICES (WITH NO DROP IN PRESSURE AT 76 PSIG) AND RAN A CAMERA INSIDE THEM TO ENSURE ALL SERVICE TEES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND TO LOOK FOR ANOMALIES. COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 448' OF HIGH DENSITY POLY ETHYLENE (HDPE) MAIN LINE AND 6 SERVICES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STREET AND IT SUCCESSFULLY PASSED SEVERAL PRESSURE TESTS AT 76 PSIG (OPERATING PRESSURE), 15 INCHES WATER COLUMN AND 150 PSIG. IN ADDITION COLUMBIA TESTED APPROXIMATELY 1,175' OF HDPE MAIN LINE AND SERVICE ON THE STREET BEHIND INCIDENT SITE. AT 613 FLEMING FALLS RD., COLUMBIA PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE AND CHECKED THE SERVICE REGULATOR FOR LOCK UP AND FLOW WITHOUT ISSUE AND NO LEAKAGE DETECTED. THE SERVICE LINE AT THE NEIGHBORING HOME (637  FLEMING FALLS RD) WAS ALSO TESTED AND FOUND TO BE LEAK FREE. COLUMBIA DID EXPLORATORY EXCAVATION AROUND THE AREA TO ENSURE CONDUITS DID NOT EXIST THAT COULD CONVEY MIGRATING GAS. COLUMBIA ALSO RAN A CAMERA IN THE SANITARY MAIN AND SEWER LATERALS TO ENSURE THAT A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST. UN-COLLAPSED STORM SEWERS WERE VIDEOED AS WELL TO ENSURE A CROSS BORE DID NOT EXIST.     COLUMBIA WORKED WITH THE PUCO, STATE FIRE MARSHALL, A THIRD-PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN SPECIALIST, AND A GEOLOGIST TO DETERMINE A CAUSE. LABORATORY GAS ANALYSES AND OUR GEOLOGIST'S INTERPRETATION INDICATE THAT THE STRAY GAS SAMPLES HAD A COMPARABLE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION AND MOLECULAR PROFILE, AND IS SIMILAR IN ORIGIN TO COLUMBIA'S PIPELINE GAS, HOWEVER, NATURALLY OCCURRING METHANE CONTAINING SIMILAR MOLECULAR AND ISOTOPIC PROFILE CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE.

THE CAUSE WAS ORIGINALLY DETERMINED TWO (2) DISCS OF THE FOAM CHAMBERS RUPTURED ALLOWING OIL TO START LEAKING OUT OF THE ANNULAR AIR HOLES ON THE PIPING JUST BELOW THE CHAMBER.  HOWEVER DURING REPAIR OPERATIONS IT WAS DISCOVERED THE PLATES DID NOT RUPTURE BUT INSTEAD WERE FOUND TO BE INCORRECTLY INSTALLED.  THE FOAM CHAMBERS INSTALLED AT THE FACILITY ARE INSTALLED FOR THE FIRE PROTECTION OF THE FIXED ROOF TANK AND HAVE BEEN IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE 2005 INTEGRITY TEST ON FILE. THEY ARE INSTALLED ON THE SIDE WALL OF VERTICAL STORAGE TANKS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM PRODUCT STORAGE LEVEL.  THE CHAMBERS ARE DESIGNED TO APPLY AN EXPANDED FOAM BLANKET OVER THE SURFACE OF A FLAMMABLE LIQUID FIRE WITHIN THE TANK.  THE ANNULAR HOLES ON THE PIPING BELOW THE CHAMBER ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW AIR TO MIX WITH THE FOAM SOLUTION TO CREATE THE FOAM BEFORE IT ENTERS THE TANK.      DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT FIELDWOOD DISCOVERED THAT THE OVERFILL OF THE TANK #5 WAS DUE TO OPERATOR ERROR AND POOR CALCULATIONS.  THE OPERATOR BELIEVED HE HAD ROOM FOR AN ADDITIONAL 4200 BBLS HOWEVER DURING HIS CALCULATING OF TANK FILL HE ALLEGEDLY FAILED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OF THE FLANGE LEVEL OF THE FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.  WHEN THE SAFETY DEVICES ALERTED OF POTENTIAL OVERFILL HE PLACED THE DEVICES IN BYPASS BELIEVING HIS CALCULATIONS WERE ACCURATE.    TO PLACE THE SAFETY DEVICE IN BYPASS THE HIGH ALARMS AT THE FACILITY ARE AIR ACTUATED ALARMS THAT CAN BE HEARD FROM ANY LOCATION ON THE FACILITY.  WHEN THE ALARM IS TRIGGERED IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND SILENCED BY FACILITY PERSONNEL FROM ONE OF TWO TERMINALS (LOCATED WITHIN THE OFFICE & MCC BUILDING).     FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION FIELDWOOD DID THE FOLLOWING:  OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FOREMEN/OPERATION LEAD HAVE INCREASED THEIR PRESENCE ON THE GRAND ISLE TANK BATTERY.  THEY SPEND ONE FULL DAY A WEEK ON LOCATION TO EVALUATE PERSONNEL AND WALK THE GROUNDS.  DAILY CALLS WILL BE MADE ALONG WITH AN EMAIL OF ALL ACTIVITIES AM/PM WILL BE SENT TO THE PRODUCTION FOREMAN AND PRODUCTION SUPERINTENDENT.

FHR OPERATIONS PERSONNEL CONTACTED THE PCC AT 17:30 TO INITIATE A SHUTDOWN OF THE PIPELINE. FHR OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED HEADER ISOLATION VALVES AS WELL AS MPL 1 & 2 STATION DISCHARGE VALVES. THE MINNESOTA DUTY OFFICER WAS CONTACTED AT 18:08 (REPORT # 194835, OFFICER LARRY # 8).     THE PUMP 4 INBOARD SEAL HAD FAILED CAUSING CRUDE OIL TO ENTER THE SCAVENGER BOX, FLOW TO THE SEAL FAIL POT, AND DRAIN INTO THE SUMP AS DESIGNED.

DURING INITIAL REPAIR ATTEMPTS, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL DETERMINED AT 18:26 THAT THE PUMP 4 DISCHARGE VALVE WOULD NOT FULLY SEAT AND THEREFORE REQUIRED REPLACEMENT. THE DETERMINATION TO REPLACE THE DISCHARGE VALVE INCREASED THE ESTIMATED REPAIR COSTS TO OVER THE $50,000 NRC REPORTING THRESHOLD. AT 19:18 FHR REPORTED THE RELEASE TO THE NRC (REPORT # 1290260, OPERATOR UPCHURCH). A 48-HOUR UPDATE WAS MADE TO THE NRC ON OCTOBER 22 TO REPORT NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE INITIAL REPORT (REPORT # 1290452, CLAUDIA).    LOCAL PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTORS WERE ON SITE TO CLEANUP THE IMPACTED SOIL.     THE PIPELINE CONTROLLER AND CONTROLLER IN TRAINING WERE SENT FOR DRUG TESTING. INITIAL INDICATIONS OF CONTROLLER ACTIONS DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE PIPELINE CONTROLLER AS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. HOWEVER, UPON REVIEW OF THE ABOVE LISTED TIMEFRAMES, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PIPELINE CONTROLLERS MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AND THAT DRUG TESTING SHOULD BE PERFORMED. DUE TO THIS DELAY IN IDENTIFICATION, THE EMPLOYEES WERE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR ALCOHOL TESTING.     BASED ON THE FOR CAUSE REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PIPELINE CONTROLLER'S RESPONSE WAS DELAYED AND THEREFORE THE PIPELINE CONTROLLER WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR OQ TASKS 43.1 AND 43.3.

ON 1/31/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE FOR INVESTIGATIONS. INITIAL PRESSURE TESTING OF THE ABANDONED MAIN AND SERVICE INDICATED AN UNDERGROUND LEAK, AND IT WAS BELIEVED NECESSARY TO EXCAVATE AT THE SERVICE TEE. SINCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH MOVING NECESSARY PERSONAL PROPERTY, FURTHER EXCAVATION WAS DELAYED UNTIL FEBRUARY 4TH.  ON 2/4/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. UPON EXCAVATION AT THE SERVICE TEE LOCATION FOR 2800 LAKESHORE WAY, A BENT SECTION OF MAIN WAS IDENTIFIED. THE MAIN WAS BENT IN AN ARC, AND WAS DISPLACED VERTICALLY BY ABOUT 3 IN. OVER A 6 FT. LENGTH. THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED AND A CRACK WAS FOUND IN THE BENT SECTION OF THE PIPE. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING A PRIOR EXCAVATION AND THAT MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE DEEP FROST LEVELS OBSERVED THIS WINTER CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE. ONE-CALL CENTER RECORDS DO NOT INDICATE ANY RECENT LOCATE TICKET REQUESTS AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITY THAT DAMAGED THE PIPE OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.  A NEW PE MAIN WAS INSTALLED ON LAKESHORE WAY AND GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED PROPERTY WAS RESTORED ON 2/14/14.  A FORMAL INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 2/21/14. PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVIEW INCLUDED GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AT THE SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS REPORTED AND OTHER COMPANY PERSONNEL WHO ASSISTED AT THE SCENE. PIPELINE SAFETY ENGINEERS FROM THE WPSC, ONE OF WHOM HAD INSPECTED THE SITE THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE, ALSO ATTENDED. THE REVIEW RECOUNTED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND INCLUDED COMMUNICATIONS CONDUCTED AMONG INVOLVED PERSONNEL.

GAS CONTROL IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE WATERLOO, IOWA COMPRESSOR PLANT TEAM ON-CALL PERSON. THE ON-CALL PERSON WAS AWARE THAT ON THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2012, THE TEAM PERSONNEL HAD INSPECTED AND TESTED COMPRESSOR UNIT # 2'S DISCHARGE RELIEF VALVE AND HAD RESET IT FROM A PRESSURE OF 1,030 PSIG TO A SET POINT PRESSURE OF 999 PSIG. DUE TO CONCERNS THAT UNIT DISCHARGE PRESSURE PULSATIONS COULD IMPACT THE RELIEF VALVE AND CAUSE IT TO BLOW PREMATURELY, THE TEAM ALSO HAD TESTED THE PULSATION IMPACT ON THE RELIEF ON MARCH 8, 2012, BY PUTTING UNIT 2 ON-LINE AND RUNNING THE DISCHARGE PRESSURE TO 958 PSIG, WHICH IS 2 PSIG BELOW THE 960 PSIG MAOP, AND THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE RELIEF VALVE BEING ACTIVATED. AS THE ON-CALL PERSON WAS AWARE OF THE PREVIOUS WORK AND CHANGES TO THE RELIEF VALVE HE WAS FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THIS COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE BLOWING GAS SO HE REQUESTED THAT GAS CONTROL REMOTELY SHUTDOWN UNIT # 2. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE PLANT THERE WAS NO GAS BLOWING. A REVIEW OF THE HISTORICAL PRESSURE TRENDS ON THE LOCATION HMI INDICATED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE STARTED TO VENT AT APRPOXIAMTELY 946 PSIG, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE 999 PSIG SET POINT, AND ALSO WELL BELOW THE MAOP OF 960 PSIG. WHEN INSPECTING AND CHANGING THE SET POINT LOCATION PERSONNEL WERE AWARE THAT THE RELIEF VALVE WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN ANDERSON GREENWOOD AGCO PRESSURE SPIKE SNUBBER.IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THIS WOULD PREVENT PREMATURE ACTIVATION OF THE RELIEF VALVE. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE UNITS WERE BEING OPERATED AT A REDUCED RATE OF SPEED AND LOAD AND THIS UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED TO DISCHARGE PRESSURE PULSATIONS, SURGES AND SPIKES THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF THE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY OF THE AGCO PRESSURE SNUBBER TO DAMPEN. ON MONDAY, MARCH 12, 2012 THE TEAM INSPECTED, RESET AND TESTED THE RELIEF VALVE AT A SET POINT OF 1,030 PSIG AND THE UNIT WAS PUT BACK INTO OPERATIONAL SERVICE. THE LOCATION IS DISCUSSING WITH THE EQUIPMENT VENDOR WHETHER THERE IS OPTIONS ON OTHER DEVICES THAT THEY MAY HAVE FOR INSTALLATION ON THE RELIEF VALVE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR OPERATION AS AT A PRESSURE SET POINT OF 999 PSIG. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TOTAL GAS RELEASED BY THE RELIEF VALVE OPENING EXCEEDED THE THREE MILLION CUBIC FEET REPORTING THRESHOLD.

RAY COMPRESSOR STATION IS LOCATED IN ARMADA, MICHIGAN (MACOMB COUNTY).     THE ON-CALL STATION MECHANIC WAS DISPATCHED AT 02:47 HOURS AND ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 03:26 HOURS AND GAS WAS NO LONGER VENTING.  SECURITY CAMERAS AT THE STATION WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE BLOWING GAS.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION THE SOURCE OF THE BLOWING GAS WAS DETERMINE TO BE THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE (PSV-00103) ON THE SLUG CATCHER.  SUBSEQUENT REVIEW OF PRESSURE DATA INDICATES GAS BEGAN VENTING AT APPROXIMATELY 02:20 HOURS AND BLEW FOR APPROXIMATELY 37 MINUTES BEFORE PRESSURE READINGS NORMALIZED.    AT APPROXIMATELY 06:30 HOURS THE SLUG CATCHER WAS ISOLATED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE GAS RELEASE.  DURING THE VISUAL INSPECTION, ICE IN THE PILOT SENSING LINE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL CAUSE.  AFTER CONSULTING WITH ENGINEERING THE DECISION WAS MADE TO ISOLATE THE SLUG CATCHER PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE AND RESUME NORMAL OPERATION OF THE SLUG CATCHER.    ON FEBRUARY 20, 2019 AFTER CONTINUED INVESTIGATION AND ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING CONSULTATION, THE SLUG CATCHER WAS BLOWN DOWN AND REMOVED FROM SERVICE PENDING A ROOT CAUSE REVIEW.    A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA) WAS CONDUCTED BY THE EXPERITEC, THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE MANUFACTURE, ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019.  A SUMMARY OF THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:  BASED ON THE MULTIPLE CONFERENCE CALLS HELD WITH TAYLOR FORGE (VESSEL MANUFACTURER), CONSUMER ENERGY, EXPERITEC AND EMERSON IT IS OUR OPINION THAT THE EXTERNAL LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND INTERNAL WET CONDITIONS OF THE NATURAL GAS CAUSED THE SUBJECT RELIEF VALVE TO FREEZE AT VARIOUS POINTS WITHIN THE VALVE. THE FREEZING CAUSED THE VALVE TO OPEN BELOW IT DESIGNATED SET PRESSURE.      THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDED THAT ALL FOUR (4) RELIEF VALVES BE HEAT TRACED AND INSULATED TO PREVENT THE POTENTIAL OF POSSIBLE FREEZING IN THE FUTURE.

SOUTHWEST GAS CREWS ARRIVED AT 09:35 PDT AND OBTAINED GAS READS OF 4 LEL BY THE RISER TO THE LAUNDRY FACILITY, TURNED OFF THE METER, CONFIRMED ZERO GAS READS INSIDE THE UNOCCUPIED BUILDING, AND CONDUCTED FURTHER LEAK INVESTIGATION.  AT 10:13 PDT, IGNITION OF FUGITIVE NATURAL GAS OCCURRED WITHIN THE DETACHED, UNOCCUPIED LAUNDRY FACILITY STRUCTURE RESULTING IN A FIRE AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.  POST IGNITION LEAK SURVEY RESULTS DISCOVERED INCREASING GAS READINGS AND LEAK SPREAD RESULTING IN AN EVACUATION OF 14 PEOPLE FROM SOME UNITS OF THE ADJACENT, SEPARATE APARTMENT BUILDING. A LEAK ON A PVC SERVICE LINE COUPLING CONNECTION FITTING WAS REVEALED DURING A LEAK TEST OF THE PVC SERVICE DURING A POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. ADDITIONALLY, A LEAK TEST PERFORMED ON THE CUSTOMER'S HOUSELINE FAILED DURING THE POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION.     PART A4: BASED ON COMMUNICATIONS THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF NEVADA'S REGULATORY OPERATIONS STAFF HAD WITH THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION'S ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION DIVISION, ""LOCAL TIME AND DATE OF THE INCIDENT"" REFLECTS THE TIME SOUTHWEST GAS WAS NOTIFIED OF A LEAK ON THE PIPELINE.  AT THAT TIME, NO INCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA WAS MET.     PART A6:  SOUTHWEST GAS NOTIFIED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) TELEPHONICALLY OF THE INCIDENT ON JUNE 24, 2020 AT 14:33 PDT.  THE NRC ISSUED REPORT NUMBER 1280311 FOR THE INCIDENT.  SOUTHWEST GAS PROVIDED A 48-HOUR UPDATE TELEPHONICALLY TO THE NRC ON JUNE 25, 2020 AT 15:28 PDT. THE NRC ISSUED REPORT NUMBER 1280402 FOR THE UPDATED REPORT.    SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:     CHANGED PART G TO UPDATE THE APPARENT CAUSE FROM PART G5 TO G8. THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION. CURRENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE CAUSE MAY BE G3, G4, OR G5.  THE SAMPLE HAS BEEN SENT TO A THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS TESTING LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS AND THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WILL BE PROVIDED IN A SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE. THE LEAK WAS ORIGINALLY BELIEVED TO BE DUE TO A SOLVENT CEMENT JOINT, BUT A CRACK WAS FOUND WHEN ASSESSED IN SOUTHWEST GAS'S MATERIALS TESTING LABORATORY. THE CRACK APPEARS TO BE A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK IN THE PIPE NEAR THE LOCATION OF THE PIPE TO COUPLING JOINT.     SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE 2:    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, THE SERVICE LINE WAS DISCONNECTED AT THE MAIN.  ON MARCH 30, 2021, THE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER WAS REPLACED.    PART C, 3 AND 4 - CHANGED THE PIPE SIZE AND WALL THICKNESS TO 0.5-INCH AND 0.109-INCH RESPECTIVELY BASED ON 3RD PARTY LABORATORY ANALYSIS.    CHANGED PART G FROM G8 - OTHER INCIDENT CAUSE TO G4 - OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE, WITH A SUB-CAUSE AS OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE.  AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY'S MATERIAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS SUSTAINED EXTERNAL BENDING LOADS LEADING TO SLOW CRACK GROWTH AND CREEP RUPTURE.   THE FIELD INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE BENDING LOADS WAS A CUSTOMER HOUSELINE WATER LEAK WHICH ERODED THE SUPPORT FROM UNDER THE SERVICE LINE'S TRANSITION FITTING.",17341.0,0.0,43.0,90.69767441860463,0.0,1.0,1.0,29.145,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE DIESEL FUEL THAT WAS RELEASED FROM THE STATION PIPING WAS COMPLETELY CONTAINED INSIDE THE TANK DIKE. NINETY-EIGHT 98 BARRELS OF FREE PHASE DIESEL FUEL WAS RECOVERED AND NINETY-ONE 91 BARRELS WAS ENTRAINED IN THE SOIL THAT WAS TESTED AND EXCAVATED FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.       EXPLORERS INVESTIGATION AND THIRD-PARTY METALLURGICAL TESTING CONCLUDED THAT THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING RELEASE WAS FROM THE PIPING BEING ISOLATED FROM THERMAL RELIEF.   A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE RELEASE WAS MICROBIAL INFLUENCED INTERNAL CORROSION. THE METALLURGICAL TEST ALSO INDICATED A CRACK LIKE FLAW HAD ADVANCED IN THE THROUGH-WALL DIRECTION, BUT DID NOT PRODUCE A LEAK OR RUPTURE PRIOR TO THE FINAL FAILURE.     AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE, THE 12 INCH PIPELINE THAT DELIVERS PRODUCT TO THE FAUNA STATION WAS SHUTDOWN AND THERE WAS 113 PSIG ON THE PIPELINE.  THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING THAT RECEIVES PRODUCT FROM THE 12 INCH PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE AND TANKAGE.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING WAS ISOLATED IT WAS ISOLATED FROM THERMAL RELIEF.      THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER FOR DELIVERIES INTO THE STATION FROM THE 12 INCH PIPELINE IS UPSTREAM OF THE FIRST MANUAL ISOLATION VALVE THAT WAS SHUT.  THEREFORE, THE EXACT PRESSURE ON THE 971 FOOT SECTION OF 16 INCH STATION PIPING INVOLVED WITH THE INCIDENT IS UNKNOWN.      THE 16 INCH STATION PIPING WAS TO BE DECOMMISSIONED FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE NEW 24 INCH CONNECTION AND MANIFOLD AT FAUNA.      THE NEW 24 INCH STATION MANIFOLD CONNECTION INTO THE FAUNA STATION WAS ISOLATED FROM THE NEW 24 INCH PIPELINE CONNECTION.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, EXPLORER WAS BYPASSING THE FAUNA STATION AND WAS MAKING A DELIVERY TO A THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE.  THE 24 INCH STATION MANIFOLD PRESSURE WAS 3.6 PSIG DURING THE DELIVERY TO THE THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE.    THE 24 INCH SYSTEM AND MANIFOLD IS A NEW OPERATION THAT HAD ESTABLISHED DELIVERY AND RECEIPT PROCEDURES.        THE 24 INCH PIPELINE DELIVERY WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN TO ALLOW FIELD PERSONNEL TO RESPOND TO THE STATION RELEASE THAT WAS TOTALLY CONTAINED INSIDE THE DIKE.       THE BURST PRESSURE OF THE REGION OF THE WALL LOSS THAT CONTAINED THE RUPTURE WAS CALCULATED USING THE RSTRENG EFFECTIVE AREA METHOD EMBODIED IN CORLAS AND RANGED FROM 342 PSIG TO 787 PSIG.      THE 971 FOOT SECTION OF 16 INCH STATION PIPING INVOLVED WAS FROM ORIGINAL 1954 CONSTRUCTION OF THE FAUNA STATION AND LIMITED DATA WAS PROVIDED FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER.

THE STATION WAS SHUT DOWN BY A POWER SURGE AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY.    AN ESTIMATED 5.5 BBLS. OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED TO SOIL FROM TWO INTERNAL CORROSION PITS IN A VALVE BODY DRAIN CONNECTION PIPE AT THE ST. JAMES-NORTH PUMP STATION.  THE RELEASE WAS DISCOVERED AND REPORTED TO EMPCO SUPERVISION BY AN EMPCO EMPLOYEE ON 4/10/12 AT 5:17 PM AFTER AN UNEXPECTED COMMERCIAL POWER FAILURE WHICH SHUT DOWN THE PUMP STATION.  THE NORTHLINE PIPELINE AND ST. JAMES-NORTH PUMP STATION WAS IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT WERE MOBILIZED TO THE SITE.  AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE.  THE ENTIRE CRUDE OIL RELEASE WAS CONTAINED WITHIN EMPCO STATION AND OIL RECLAIMED VIA VACUUM TRUCK WITHIN 3 HOURS OF THE RELEASE DISCOVERY.   A REVIEW OF SCADA SYSTEM PIPELINE SURVEILLANCE DATA (LEVEL 1) DID NOT INDICATE ANY ABNORMAL CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESUMED SLOW RELEASE RATE.  SUSPECTED INTERNAL CORROSION WAS DISCOVERED IN A VALVE BODY BLEED PIPE DETAIL.  THE RECONDITIONED VALVE WAS INSTALLED IN 2003 AS PART OF A PROJECT TO CONSTRUCT THE PUMP STATION.  THE VALVE WAS REMOVED AND BLIND FLANGE INSTALLED TO ENABLE RE-COMMISSIONING OF THE PIPELINE USING AN ADJACENT SIMILAR PUMP UNIT.  DRAIN PIPING OF THREE IDENTICAL PUMP STATION ISOLATION VALVES WERE PRESSURE TESTED PRIOR TO STATION RE-COMMISSIONING.  A LOSS INVESTIGATION IS IN-PROGRESS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO QUICKLY ADDRESS THREE SIMILAR REMAINING VALVES IN THE PUMP STATION.  THE ORIGINAL NRC REPORT # 1008304 SHOWED THE RELEASE AMOUNT TO BE 11 BBLS.  THAT VOLUME WAS DETERMINED TO BE INCORRECT; THE CORRECT VOLUME WAS DETERMINED BY THE AMOUNT RECOVERED IN THE VACUUM TRUCK.

THE ESD SYSTEM WAS RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE ON JUNE 12, 2015.  DURING THIS TIME, THE CS WAS MANNED.  THE KEY LESSONS IDENTIFIED FROM THIS INCIDENT WAS THAT COLUMBIA PERSONNEL TO ASSURE QUARTER TURN VALVES ARE IN THE OPEN POSITION AFTER ANY VALVE MAINTENANCE IS PERFORMED AND TO PERIODICALLY CHECK THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT AREA FOR ANY FUTURE SIGNS OF TAMPERING OR EVIDENCE OF RODENTS.

AFTER I COMPLETED THE WELDING AND SUCCESSFUL PRESSURE TESTING OF TWO BOLT ON VALVE FLANGE WELDS AND ONE WELD SECURING THE 2 INCH TEE TO THE PREEXISTING 37 PSI, 2 INCH GAS MAIN, ALL FOUR OF US PROCEEDED TO COMMENCE DRILLING THE MAIN TO INTRODUCE GAS TO THE NEW MAIN BY UTILIZING ONE OF OUR MUELLER E-4 MODEL DRILLING MACHINES. UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE DRILLING PROCESS TECHNICIAN 1 RAISED THE SHELL CUTTER INTO THE DRILLING MACHINE CHAMBER AND THE GATE VALVE WAS CLOSED TO STOP OFF GAS FLOW FROM THE TOP OF THE TEE. THE DRILLING MACHINE WAS DISASSEMBLED FROM THE GATE VALVE AND THE SHELL CUTTER DISASSEMBLED AND THE COMPLETION PLUG INSTALLED. ONCE TECHNICIAN 1 REASSEMBLED THE MACHINE IT WAS REATTACHED TO THE TOP OF THE GATE VALVE AND THE VALVE WAS OPENED ALLOWING THE COMPLETION PLUG TO BE LOWERED INTO THE TOP OF THE TEE AND THREADED INTO IT. ONCE THE PLUG WAS THREADED INTO THE TEE AND TIGHT THE SHAFT WAS REMOVED FROM THE COMPLETION PLUG AND THE MACHINE WAS REMOVED AGAIN FROM THE GATE VALVE. THE GATE VALVE WAS THEN REMOVED AND THE COMPLETION PLUG WRENCH WAS PUT INTO THE TOP OF THE COMPLETION PLUG BY TECHNICIAN 1. TECHNICIAN 1 PERFORMED ALL THE ASSEMBLY AND DISASSEMBLY OF THE MACHINE. TECHNICIAN 1 THEN TURNED THE PLUG TIGHTENING IT INTO THE TEE A 1/4 - 1/2 TURN AND THEN HANDED THE WRENCH TO TECHNICIAN 3 AND TOLD HIM TO FINISH TIGHTENING THE PLUG. TECHNICIAN 3 THEN FITTED THE WRENCH INTO THE TOP OF THE COMPLETION PLUG. HE IS RIGHT HANDED SO HE PUT HIS LEFT HAND ON TOP OF THE WRENCH TO SECURE IT AND HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE HANDLE TO TURN IT. AS SOON AS HE STARTED TO TURN THE PLUG IT BLEW OUT THE TOP. AT THE TIME THAT IT BLEW OUT I (FOREMAN) WAS SEATED ON THE EAST EDGE OF THE BELL HOLE, TECHNICIAN 2 WAS SEATED ON THE SOUTH EDGE, TECHNICIAN 3 WAS STANDING IN THE SOUTH WEST CORNER OF THE PREEXISTING AND NEW MAINS AND TECHNICIAN 1 WAS STANDING IN THE NORTH WEST CORNER OF THE PREEXISTING AND NEW MAINS. I ROLLED AWAY FROM THE EXCAVATION. I LOOKED TO MY LEFT AND SAW THAT TECHNICIAN 2 WAS CLEAR OF THE HOLE. I LOOKED RIGHT AND SAW TECHNICIAN 3 MOVING WEST IN THE DITCH AWAY FROM IT. I LOOKED RIGHT AND SAW TECHNICIAN 1 LOOKING AROUND ALL AROUND HIM I YELLED ARE YOU OK AND HE GAVE ME A THUMBS UP AND CONTINUED LOOKING AROUND HIM. I LOOKED AT TECHNICIAN 3 AND SAW HIS FACE WAS OBVIOUS SHOCK. I SAW HIM HOLDING HIS LEFT ARM AND THEN SAW HIS ARM STARTING TO BLEED. I THEN RAN AROUND THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOLE AND GRABBED TECHNICIAN 3 AND PULLED HIM OUT OF THE DITCH AND TOOK HIM TO GET A FIRST AID KIT. AT THIS TIME I SAW HOW BAD HIS ARM WAS BLEEDING SO I KEYED UP ON THE CITY RADIO AND STATED SULLIVAN EMS SULLIVAN EMS YOU ARE NEEDED NOW AT THE H&R BLOCK BUILDING ON SOUTH HAMILTON STREET INJURED CITY EMPLOYEE WITH SHRAPNEL WOUNDS TO HIS LEFT FOREARM AND BICEP WITH SEVERE BLEEDING. I REPEATED THIS MESSAGE TWICE ON THE RADIO. I THEN TURNED TO TECHNICIAN 3 AND BEGAN MEDICAL TRIAGE. HE SAID IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING IS MOVING UP MY ARM! I THEN TOOK OFF MY LEATHER BELT AND TOLD HIM IM GONNA TIE OFF YOUR ARM! I USED MY BELT JUST BELOW HIS LEFT ARMPIT TO APPLY A TOURNIQUET. I WRAPPED IT TIGHT AND GAVE HIM THE LOOSE END AND TOLD HIM TO HOLD IT AND NOT LET GO UNTIL THE EMTS TOLD HIM TO. MOMENTS LATER EMTS ARRIVED AND TOOK TECHNICIAN 3 TO ST MARYS HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE IN DECATUR IL. I TURNED BACK TO TECHNICIANS 1 AND 2 AND THEY HAD ALREADY PUT THE GATE VALVE BACK ON AND SHUT DOWN THE GAS.

AREA PERSONNEL ARRANGED FOR HELICOPTER, FLEW OVER AREA, AND CONFIRMED BUBBLES ON JUNE 19 AT APPROXIMATELY 09:10. NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE AND LINE WAS ISOLATED AND PRESSURED DOWN TO 0 PSIG. ON JUNE 21, A SONAR INSPECTION WAS DONE BUT WATER WAS AT A HIGH LEVEL WITH THE EAST BANK RIGHT-OF-WAY FLOODED AND INACCESSIBLE. DUE TO THE WATER MOVEMENT AND FLOODING IT WAS UNSAFE FOR DIVING OPERATIONS; INCIDENT SITE IS APPROXIMATELY 80 FEET BELOW WATER. MULTIPLE SONAR PASSES WERE RECORDED FROM APPROXIMATELY THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER TOWARD THE WEST BANK WHERE THE SUSPECTED LEAK IS LOCATED. SONAR INDICATES THERE MAY BE A POSSIBLE EXPOSURE ON THE HELENA 12"" #1 LINE (HEL 12-1). IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS SECTION OF THIS LINE WILL BE ABANDONED.    9-6-19 EMAIL RECEIVED FROM PHMSA INDICATED THAT THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE INDICATED ON THIS REPORT DOES NOT FALL ON THE REFERENCED MAPPED PIPELINE.  THIS PIPELINE IS UNDER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND THE LOCATION PROVIDED IS WHERE BUBBLES WERE FOUND IN THE WATER; THIS IS THE MOST ACCURATE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE LINE IS STILL SHUT IN.     ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE PIPE OR A WELD, TO ACCOMMODATE PHMSA'S REQUEST FOR PIPE DATA, THE ANSWERS PROVIDED IN PART C HAVE CHANGED FROM ""ITEM INVOLVED IN INCIDENT = UNKNOWN,"" TO ""ITEM INVOLVED IN INCIDENT = PIPE.""    REGARDING THE COSTS AND ABANDONMENT, COST HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM $5,000,000 TO $1,400,000 BECAUSE TEXAS GAS ORIGINALLY EXPECTED TO REPAIR THE LINE BUT INSTEAD WILL CHECK THE INTEGRITY OF THE HEL 12-2 (PARALLEL LINE) AND CONSIDER ABANDONING THE HEL 12-1; IF THIS APPROACH IS USED, PIG TRAPS MAY ALSO BE INSTALLED.    CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.  THIS LINE IS OUT OF SERVICE AND THE LOCATION IS UNDER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.  NO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO CAUSE IS PLANNED.    11-14-19 UPDATE: TEXAS GAS WILL INVESTIGATE USING A DIVING TEAM. AT THIS TIME, THE CAUSE REMAINS UNKNOWN. ADDITIONALLY, TEXAS GAS PLANS TO PERFORM AN INLINE INSPECTION ON THE PARALLEL LINE.    3-25-2020 DIVERS WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT.  THE PIPELINE INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT HAS NOW BEEN ABANDONED IN PLACE. A SECOND REDUNDANT PIPELINE IN THE SAME RIGHT-OF-WAY WAS MODIFIED AND INLINE INSPECTED TO ENSURE ITS INTEGRITY. INLINE INSPECTION SHOWED THIS PIPELINE IS FIT FOR SERVICE. SUBSEQUENTLY, GAS WAS RE-ROUTED TO THIS PIPELINE TO PROVIDE SERVICE. TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD REQUIRE PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE ABANDONED PIPELINE.  DOING SO WOULD REQUIRE DIVERS TO JET OUT APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF SILT FROM THE RIVER BOTTOM.  THIS ACTION WOULD NOT ONLY POSE SIGNIFICANT RISK TO PERSONNEL BUT COULD POSSIBLY JEOPARDIZE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SECOND PIPELINE NOW IN SERVICE.",25370.0,0.0,914.0,74.72647702407002,1.0,0.0,0.0,24.32,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 GALLONS OF CRUDE RELEASED FROM THE SEAL OF THE PUMP.   THERE WAS NO SOIL REMEDIATION REQUIRED AS THE VERY SMALL SPILL IGNITED AND BURNED.  THE PUMP WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND THE SPILL AREA WAS MINIMIZED TO WHAT HAD SPRAYED FROM THE SEAL FAILURE.    ROOT CAUSE BASED ON ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  AT 9:25 AM THE STATION DISCHARGE SET POINT HAD BEEN RAISED RFROM 1365 PSIG TO 1395 PSIG BY THE CONTROL CENTER TO INCREASE RATE ON THE PIPELINE. SINCE UNIT #2 WAS ALREADY AT MAXIMUM OUTPUT, THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE WAS ACHIEVED BY THE INCREASED SPEED OF UNIT #1 THROUGH THE PID CONTROL LOOP. AS A RESULT THE INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE BETWEEN THE PUMPS INCREASED FROM 750 PSIG TO 787 PSIG.     UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT, THE SEAL IN PUMP #2 WAS FOUND TO BE RATED TO 800 PSIG VERSUS THE 1000 PSIG AS DESIGNED.  THE SEAL WAS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED AS IT DID NOT MEET THE SPECIFICATION OF THE DESIGN BY COMPANY ENGINEERS. THE SEAL WAS SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE.  THE VENDOR HAD FAILED TO INSTALL THE HIGHER RATED SEAL UPON BUILDING THE PUMP.     THE HIGHER SUCTION PRESSURE OF THE #2 PUMP ALONG WITH THE PUMP SEAL FLUSH CIRCUIT FINALLY OVERPRESSURED THE #2 PUMP TANDEM SEAL RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTAINMENT.  AS THE INCIDENT BEGAN TO UNFOLD, THE #2 PUMP THRUST-END PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SEALS WERE DAMAGED, RESULTING IN FRICTION AT THE PUMP SHAFT, HEAT AND THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THE FIRE.  THE FIRE WAS IMMEDIATE UPON THE SEAL FAILURE.",432.0,1.0,1480.0,94.25675675675676,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.49,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK IN CPL'S MIDLAND STATION NEAR MIDLAND, TEXAS IN MIDLAND COUNTY, TEXAS. CPL DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE THE ARCO 1 PUMP SHAFT SEAL AND IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE LEAK. HOWEVER, 4 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED, OF WHICH, 2 BARRELS WERE PROMPTLY RECOVERED IN LIQUID FORM. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACCIDENT.     CPL REPORTED THE LEAK TO THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION, OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY AT 12:31 CST ON JULY 5, 2021 AND WAS ISSUED INCIDENT NUMBER 2439 IN REFERENCE TO THE INCIDENT.    CPL'S DETAILED ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE ARCO 1 PUMP SHAFT BEARINGS FAILED DUE TO WEAR AFTER 10 YEARS OF SERVICE CAUSING THE MECHANICAL SEAL TO DISENGAGE FROM THE SEAL SEAT AND ALLOW OIL TO LEAK FROM THE PUMP. DURING THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, CPL DISCOVERED THAT THE VIBRATION TRANSMITTER WAS DISCONNECTED. WHEN CONNECTED, THE TRANSMITTER SENSES EXCESSIVE VIBRATION AND RELAYS A SIGNAL THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUT THE PUMP DOWN. CPL RECONNECTED THE ARCO 1 PUMP VIBRATION TRANSMITTER AND INSTALLED SEAL LEAK AND VIBRATION DETECTION ON BOTH ARCO 1 AND ARCO 2 PARALLEL PUMPS.

THE FIRST VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THE RELEASE POINT IDENTIFIED THAT FOUR FACTORY INSTALLED BOLTS USED TO HOLD THE LOWER TRUNNION TO THE BALL VALVE WERE FOUND BROKEN OFF. THE UNINTENTIONAL AMOUNT OF GAS RELEASED WAS 600.3 MCF. TO REPAIR THE ISSUE THE DAMAGED VALVE WAS REMOVED AND BLIND FLANGES WERE INSTALLED ON BOTH ENDS OF THE PIPELINE. ON 02/24/2019 THE LINE WAS PURGED AND PUT BACK INTO SERVICE. THE ABNORMALLY HIGH REPAIR COSTS WERE DUE TO SNG CHOOSING TO MOBILIZE ITS CONTRACTOR AND WORK THROUGH THE WEEKEND TO MAKE THE REPAIRS SO THAT THE PIPELINE SYSTEM COULD BE RESTORED TO FULL CAPACITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THUS MINIMIZING THE IMPACT TO DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS. THE ESTIMATED COST FOR REPAIRING THIS ISSUE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS $40,000.     AFTER A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, THE FAILURE OF THE BOLTS WAS DETERMINED TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT, IN THE FORM OF HYDROGEN-STRESS CRACKING. THE TENSILE STRENGTH AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE BOLTS CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASTM A193 GRADE B7 MATERIAL. HOWEVER, THE BOLTS DID NOT MEET THE ASTM A193 B7 HARDNESS SPECIFICATION. THE BOLTS HAD A HARDNESS OF 40 HRC, WHICH EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM ASTM A193 B7 HARDNESS REQUIREMENTS OF 35 HRC. THE HARDNESS CONDITION INCREASED THE MICROSTRUCTURE'S SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HYDROGEN CRACKING.

A FIRE WAS DISCOVERED, BY A NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY EMPLOYEE, AT THE REDFIELD UNDERGROUND STORAGE FIELD, LOCATED NEAR REDFIELD, IOWA, IN THE SL PETER UNDERGROUND STORAGE FORMATION AT WHAT IS CALLED THE MAHER #3  WELL SITE IN SECTION 12, T19N, R29W, DALLAS COUNTY, IOWA. THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION, NO INJURIES, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS.     AT APPROXIMATELY 24:00 HOURS THE ST PETER FORMATION PIPELINE SYSTEM PORTION, OF THE STORAGE FIELD, WAS ISOLATED AND PRESSURE WAS BLOWN DOWN ON THE PIPING TO 5 PSIG TO ENABLE SAFE CLOSURE OF THE MAHER #3 WELL HEAD VALVE (SEE PAGE 2, ITEM 15A). THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY 01:50 A.M. THE FIRE DESTROYED THE WELL HOUSE BUILDING AND ALL OF THE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE BUILDING BUT THE WELL HEAD VALVE AND PIPING WERE UNAFFECTED. THE PORTION OF THE ST. PETER PIPING, THAT WAS ISOLATED IN ORDER TO FACILITATE REDUCTION IN PRESSURE FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE MAHER #3 WELL HEAD VALVE, WAS RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION PRESSURES AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00 A.M. ON MONDAY, JANUARY 11TH (SEE PAGE 2, ITEM 15B).    PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THAT THE GAS LEAKAGE APPEARED TO BE FROM A BROKEN ONE-INCH UNION ON THE WELL SEPARATOR DRAIN LINE. THE UNION'S THREADS APPEARED TO BE STRIPPED OR PULLED. AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WAS 21 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND THE WIND WAS OUT OF THE WEST AT APPROXIMATELY 14 MILES PER HOUR. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FREEZING AND HEAVING MAY HAVE CREATING SUFFICIENT THERMAL STRESS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEPARATION OF THE THREADS ON THE ONE-INCH UNION. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE FAILURE THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATE LOW TEMPERATURE OF - 19 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN THE AREA. ADDITIONAL METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED TO ASSIST WITH DETERMINING WHETHER THERMAL STRESS FROM THE COLD TEMPERATURES COULD BE A ROOT CAUSE FOR STRIPPING OF THE THREADS AND THE UNION'S FAILURE.    FINAL REPORT: A METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE FAILED ONE-INCH UNION INDICATED THAT TWO PORTIONS OF THE UNION'S THREADS DEMONSTRATED ROLLED DAMAGE TO THE TOP OF THE THREADS, WHICH INDICATES THE COMPONENT PULLED OVER THE PEAK OF THE THREAD AS IT DISENGAGED. AN EXAMINATION OF THE THREADS ALSO INDICATES ONE FLATTENED/ROUNDED LOCATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED OR IMPROPERLY MACHINED PREVIOUS TO THE FAILURE. THE FITTING WAS INSTALLED IN 2006, AND MAY HAVE BEEN FAULTY AND THE FROZEN CONDITION OF THE DRAIN LINE, ON DECEMBER 10, 2010, MOST LIKELY CREATED THERMAL STRESS, WHICH RESULTED IN FAILURE OF THE FITTING. AS A MEASURE TO PREVENT RECURRENCE, ALL WELL SEPARATOR DRAIN LINES AT THE REDFIELD, IOWA UNDERGROUND STORAGE FACILITY WERE DISSEMBLED AND INSPECTED. NO OTHER ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WERE FOUND. THE FIRE APPEARS TO HAVE STARTED IMMEDIATELY AS THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF AN EXPLOSION. THE WIRING IN THE CONDUIT, STATIC ELECTRICITY OR SPARKS FROM THE BUILDING STRUCTURE OR THE ONE-INCH PIPE STRIKING OTHER PIPING WHEN IT SEPARATED WAS THE LIKELY IGNITION SOURCE.

THE POTENTIAL LEAK WAS DISCOVERED DUE TO A STAIN ON THE GROUND.  THE SUSPECTED LEAK AREA WAS NEAR CITGO'S D10 6"" LCO WASH PIPELINE AND CITGO'S D08 24-INCH CAT FEED PIPELINE, WITH SEVERAL OTHER THIRD PARTY PIPELINES IN THIS AREA.  BOTH OF CITGO'S PIPELINES WERE ISOLATED AND NOT IN SERVICE AT THE TIME OF THIS LEAK DISCOVERY AND THERE WAS NO ACTIVE LEAK VISIBLE.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON THE CITGO D10 PIPELINE FIRST, DUE TO RECENT POSITIVE PRESSURE TEST DATA ON THE CITGO D08 PIPELINE.  THE D10 PIPELINE WAS PRESSURE TESTED AND WAS ELIMINATED AS THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.    THE D08 24-INCH CAT FEED PIPELINE WAS THEN HYDRO TESTED ON 1/28/2021, WHICH FAILED.  THIS PIPELINE HAD JUST RECENTLY PASSED A PRESSURE TEST ON 6/25/2020.  THE PREVIOUS TEST CONSISTED OF A SPIKE TEST OF 139% (397 PSIG) OF THE MOP FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES, A PRESSURE TEST OF 125% (357 PSIG) OF THE MOP FOR AT LEAST 4 HOURS AND AN ADDITIONAL HOLD OF 110% (314 PSIG) OF MOP FOR AT LEAST 4 MORE HOURS SINCE THE ENTIRE LINE WAS NOT VISIBLE.    THE PREVIOUS TIME THE D08 PIPELINE WAS UTILIZED FOR A PIPELINE MOVEMENT WAS TO TRANSFER SWEET CAT FEED FROM PUBLIC OIL DOCK #3 TO THE DEEP SEA TERMINAL INITIATED ON 11/30/2020.  MAXIMUM DISCHARGE PRESSURE REACHED DURING THE TRANSFER WAS 60 PSIG AND THE TRANSFER WAS COMPLETED ON 12/1/2020.    AFTER THE FAILED HYDRO TEST ON 1/28/2021, FURTHER EXCAVATION AND TESTING CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS A PINHOLE LEAK AT A 24-INCH ELBOW IN THE CAT FEED PIPELINE AND WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  THE LINE HAD BEEN ISOLATED, DE-INVENTORIED AND FILLED WITH WATER AT THIS TIME FOR THE HYDRO TEST.     CALLS TO THE NRC AND THE RRCT WERE MADE AT THIS TIME REPORTING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE LEAK.     THE SCADA SYSTEM WAS FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATING AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT, HOWEVER, DID NOT INDICATE ANY ISSUES DUE TO THE SMALL LEAK.    THE D08 LINE IS UNDER CATHODIC PROTECTION BUT NOT CATHODICALLY INSULATED FROM OTHER LINES IN DEEP SEA AREA OR PUBLIC DOCK FACILITIES AND SO INDIVIDUAL CATHODIC PROTECTION HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED. THE D08 PIPELINE WAS LAST ASSESSED FOR ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION ON 5/1/2020, WITH SOME COATING LOSS/CHALKING AND WAX TAPE DAMAGE NOTED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE NEXT ASSESSMENT INTERVAL.    THE LEAK RESULTED IN 2.2 GALLONS (0.1 BARRELS) OF HYDROCARBON RELEASED TO SOIL. THE VOLUME WAS CALCULATED BASED ON THE AREA OF HYDROCARBON CONTAMINATION ON THE GROUND (14.1 FT2 X 0.25 INCHES DEEP).    THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS FAILURE OF THE BITUMASTIC COATING RESULTING IN LOCALIZED CORROSION AT THE SOIL TO AIR INTERFACE DUE TO ITS SHALLOW BURIAL DEPTH (~2 TO 3 INCHES). ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE PIPELINE WAS INSTALLED IN 1959 AND THAT APPROXIMATELY 552 FEET OF THE D08 PIPELINE (D08 IS A TOTAL OF 4,805 FEET LONG) WAS BURIED AT THIS SHALLOW DEPTH. THE SHALLOW PORTION RUNS FROM THE DOCK ROAD CROSSING TOWARD PUBLIC DOCK 7.    REMEDIATION OF THE SITE HAS COMMENCED, BUT IS NOT COMPLETE DUE TO ADDITIONAL EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES STILL OCCURRING IN THE AREA AS PART OF ADDITIONAL INSPECTION, INVESTIGATION, AND REPAIR. A TOTAL OF 20 YARDS OF SOIL HAVE BEEN REMEDIATED. DUE TO THE MANY PIPELINES IN THE AREA, HYDRO-EXCAVATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE ONLY SAFE METHOD TO EXPOSE THE PIPELINE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, ALL SOIL BEING REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION HAS BEEN DISPOSED OF AS CONTAMINATED SOIL. THIS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL DISPOSAL COSTS FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR.    THE CITGO D08 24-INCH CAT FEED PIPELINE SEGMENT TO PUBLIC DOCK #7 IS STILL ISOLATED, BLINDED AND DE-INVENTORIED, AS THE PIPELINE REPAIR AND ASSESSMENT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED DUE TO OTHER PRIORITIES.  THIS D08 PIPELINE WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUT OF SERVICE IN THIS SAFE ISOLATED STATE UNTIL RESOURCES CAN BE ALLOCATED TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SHALLOW BURIED PIPE.",22665.0,1.0,285.0,70.17543859649122,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.445,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I WAS COMMUTING VIA PHONE WITH GAS CONTROL AND THE ERL PHONE CALL TO  COORDINATE GETTING GAS BACK INTO SERVICE AND GETTING CONSTRUCTION CREWS ON THE WAY TO HELP REPAIR THE  BROKEN GAS LINE. AFTER WE WERE SURE ALL BLOWING GAS HAD BEEN SECURED I HAD THE COMPRESSOR OPERATORS  START RETURNING UNITS BACK TO SERVICE. ACCORDING TO THE HISTORICAL DATA ON THE SCADA THE COMPRESSORS  STARTED BACK IN SERVICE AT 8:14 AM. WE THEN ASKED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO COME INTO THE COMPRESSOR  STATION AND PUT OUT THE SMALL FIRE (NONE GAS) ON THE #14 COMP. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THEN WENT TO THE  NORTH SIDE OF THE STATION OUTSIDE OUR PROPERTY AND PUT OUT A SMALL BRUSH FIRE. WITH THE DAMAGED PIPE  ISOLATED THIS TOOK 5 COMPRESSORS OUT OF SERVICE.

UPON DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE, THE EMPLOYEE CONTACTED THE CONTROL CENTER AND THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN AND THE TANK MANIFOLD AREA WAS ISOLATED.     A PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION INDICATES THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS A ""DEAD LEG"" IN THE TANK MANIFOLD AREA THAT WAS NOT CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE. INITIAL ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THE LEAK MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY MICROBIOLOGICALLY-INFLUENCED CORROSION (MIC) DUE TO THE STATIC STATE OF THE DEAD LEG; HOWEVER, AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TEAM HAS BEEN CREATED TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE RELEASE.  THE DEAD LEG HAS BEEN ISOLATED AND WILL BE REMOVED AND SUBMITTED FOR ANALYSIS AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.     AS SOON AS IT WAS DETERMINED THE RELEASE MET ACCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA IT WAS PROMPTLY REPORTED TO THE NRC (REPORT NUMBERS: 1122929 AND 1124740), WDEQ (REPORT NUMBER: 150716-0958), AND THE LEPC.

SGO DISPATCHED AN EMPLOYEE TO INVESTIGATE AND AT 20:15 REPORTED THEY HAD FOUND A LEAK ON CEGT'S ROW FOR THE BT-1 SYSTEM.  AT 20:17 SGO CONTACTED THE CEGT PIPELINE TEAM TO ADVISE THEM OF THE LEAK.  A TEAM MEMBER WAS SENT TO THE LEAK LOCATION TO VERIFY THE LEAK.      AT 20:48 THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED TO BE ON CEGT'S LINE BT-1-AS AND REPORTED TO SYSTEM CONTROL.  IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE A MINOR LEAK.  CEGT BEGAN WORKING WITH SGO TO UNDERSTAND THE CUSTOMER LOAD.  EMPLOYEES WERE STATIONED AT THE LEAK TO MAN IT UNTIL THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.     AT 21:15 CEGT AREA MANAGEMENT NOTIFIED SYSTEM CONTROL THAT THEY HAD GENERATED A PLAN TO LOWER THE PRESSURE ON A 16 MILE SECTION OF BT1-AS FROM 870# TO 400#.  AT 22:00 PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO BEGIN MOVING ALL CUSTOMERS POSSIBLE TO AN ALTERNATIVE CEGT PIPELINE.      ON 2/19/2011 AT 01:30 CREWS BEGAN BLOWING DOWN AND THE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED TO 400# BY 03:30.  PERSONNEL STAYED AT EACH MLV LOCATION MONITORING PRESSURES (12 HOUR ROTATION FOR DURATION OF INCIDENT).    ON 2/21/2011 AT 11:00 EXCAVATION BEGAN TO INSTALL A STOPPLE FITTING 3.5 MILES NORTH OF THE LEAK.      ON 2/22/2011 AT 11:00 THE STOPPALL WAS COMPLETED AND CEGT TEAM PERSONNEL BLEW DOWN A 6.6 MILE PIPELINE SECTION CONTAINING THE LEAK.  AT 15:00 THE LEAK WAS EXPOSED ENOUGH TO DETERMINE A CAUSE, APPROXIMATELY A  4"" CRACK IN THE PIPE.      ON 2/23/2011 AT 16:30 PIPE WAS DELIVERED AND WELD CAPS WERE INSTALLED.  AT 19:00 A 4 HOUR HYDRO TEST BEGAN, IT ENDED NEAR 24:00.      ON 2/24/2011 AT 07:00 CONTRACTORS BEGAN TO REMOVE THE PIPE TO BE REPLACED.  AT 10:00 THE CREW BEGAN INSTALLING THE NEW SECTION OF PIPE.    ON 2/25/2011 CREWS COMPLETED THE REPLACEMENT AND AT 17:00 BEGAN PURGING.  THE PURGE WAS COMPLETED AT 19:30.        ON 2/26/2011 AT 07:30 THE CREW BEGAN BACKFILLING AT LEAK EXCAVATION, RECOATING AT STOPPLE FITTING LOCATION AND THEN RELOADED THE LINE.  AT 16:00 THE SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATIONS.      THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED WAS SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FINAL FAILURE MODE WAS DUCTILE OVERLOAD OF THE REMAINING LIGAMENT BENEATH THE SCC.  THE REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS OBSERVED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS MINIMUM.  THE FACT THAT THESE CRACKS WERE CRITICAL AT THIS SIZE INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF A RELATIVELY HIGH AXIAL LOAD.

TWO ADULT INDIVIDUALS WERE INSIDE THE STRUCTURE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY HOSPITALIZED.  THE INCIDENT SEVERELY DAMAGED THE STRUCTURE AT 3645 E.57TH ST, WHICH WAS RAZED ON THE EVENING OF 8-3-21 BY CITY OF CLEVELAND CONTRACTORS.  TWO NEIGHBORING STRUCTURES (3643 AND 3649 E.57TH ST) ALSO SUSTAINED DAMAGES.    ON 8-3-21, AT APPROX. 2:00 PM, DOMINION ENERGY OHIO (DEO) RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CITY OF CLEVELAND FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTING THE INCIDENT.  DEO FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED AT APPROX. 2:12 PM AND STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS TO 3645 E.57TH BY CLOSING THE SERVICE LINE CURB VALVE AT APPROX. 2:35 PM.  DEO ALSO SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF GAS TO NEIGHBORING STRUCTURES (3643 AND 3649 E.57TH) BY CLOSING THE SERVICE LINE CURB VALVES.    DEO BAR-HOLED ALONG THE MAINS ON BOTH SIDES OF E.57TH AND ALONG THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINES AT 3633, 3639, 3642, 3643, 3644, 3645, 3646, 3649, 3653, AND 3659 E.57TH, AND 0% READINGS WERE FOUND.  DEO LEAK SURVEYED ALONG E.57TH AS WELL AS E.54TH, E.55TH, AND E.59TH.  NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A GRADE-TWO LEAK AT 3683 E.55TH.  DEO PERFORMED ODORANT TESTING AT 3653 E.57TH, AND THE ODORANT WAS READILY DETECTIBLE AT 0.48%.    ON 8-3-21, THE GAS METER, MANIFOLD, AND A SECTION OF SERVICE LINE PIPING WERE REMOVED FROM THE BASEMENT AT 3645 E.57TH.  DEO PRESSURE TESTED THE REMAINING SERVICE LINE PIPING AT 3645 E.57TH AT 7 OZ (OPERATING PRESSURE) FOR 10 MIN.  A PRESSURE DROP OF APPROX. 0.5 OZ WAS OBSERVED, BUT NO LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.  A SECTION CONTAINING THE CURB VALVE AND MAIN-TO-CURB TRANSITION WAS REMOVED, AND THE REMAINING SERVICE LINE WAS RE-TESTED AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN.  A PRESSURE DROP OF APPROX. 0.5 OZ WAS OBSERVED.  CITY CONTRACTORS RAZED THE STRUCTURE AT 3645 E.57TH THAT EVENING.      ON 8-4-21, DEO EXCAVATED, EXPOSED, AND RE-TESTED THE REMAINING SERVICE LINE (APPROX. 24 FT) AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN.   A PRESSURE DROP OF APPROX. 1 OZ WAS OBSERVED, BUT NO IDENTIFIABLE LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.  A CUT WAS MADE APPROX. 8 FT FROM THE END OF THE SERVICE LINE (CLOSEST TO THE MAIN), AND THE 8-FT SECTION WAS RE-TESTED AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN.  A PRESSURE DROP OF SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 2 OZ WAS OBSERVED, BUT NO IDENTIFIABLE LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.  THE REMAINING 16-FT SECTION WAS RE-TESTED AT 7 OZ FOR 10 MIN, AND NO PRESSURE DROP WAS OBSERVED.    THE GAS METER, MANIFOLD, AND SERVICE LINE SECTIONS WERE PRESERVED FOR LABORATORY INSPECTION AND TESTING.  THREE APPLIANCES (FURNACE, WATER HEATER, AND STOVE/RANGE) AND MISCELLANEOUS HOUSE LINE PIPING ALSO WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE CITY'S POST-DEMOLITION DEBRIS REMOVAL ON 8-5-21 AND 8-6-21.  THESE ARTIFACTS WERE EXAMINED ON 9-17-21.  THE 8-FT SECTION OF SERVICE LINE THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS TESTED ON 8-4-21 WAS FLOW RATE LEAK TESTED AT 7 OZ, AND NO MEASURABLE FLOW RATE WAS OBSERVED.  THE SERVICE LINE SECTION FROM THE BASEMENT OF 3645 E.57TH WAS KINKED APPROX. 45 DEGREES BY THE CITY'S CONTRACTORS DURING ITS REMOVAL ON 8-3-21, AND A THROUGH-WALL CRACK WAS OBSERVED AT THE KINK.    THE KINKED SERVICE LINE SECTION WAS EXAMINED ON 12-17-21, WHICH INCLUDED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCANNING.  EVIDENCE OF EXTERNAL CORROSION AND THINNING OF THE PIPING WALL WAS OBSERVED IN THE AREA WHERE THE SERVICE LINE PASSED THROUGH THE FOUNDATION INTO THE BASEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT TO BE LESS RESISTANT TO BENDING FORCES.  THE CRACK AT THE KINK WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED, REVEALING THAT THE PIPING WALL WAS COLLAPSED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE SERVICE LINE.    FOR REPORTING PURPOSES, DEO CLASSIFIES THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT AS EXTERNAL CORROSION FAILURE (SEE PART G1), BUT THE ROOT CAUSE REMAINS UNKNOWN AND UNDETERMINED.  A NATURAL GAS LEAK FROM EXTERNAL CORROSION ON THE SERVICE LINE INSIDE THE BASEMENT CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS A POSSIBLE FUEL SOURCE, BUT THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS COMPROMISED DURING POST-INCIDENT REMOVAL BY THE CITY'S CONTRACTORS.",22129.0,0.0,1.0,44.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24.35,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FOLLOWING THE AUGUST 14, 2014 RELEASE AT MP 62.5, MAGELLAN MADE THE DETERMINATION TO COMPLETE A HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TEST (INCLUDING A SPIKE TEST) OF THIS PIPELINE, DESIGNATED AS THE ENID LATERAL, BEFORE RETURNING IT TO SERVICE.  WHILE ON TEST, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LINE WAS LOSING PRESSURE WHICH INDICATED A POTENTIAL PINHOLE SOMEWHERE ELSE ON THE PIPELINE.  FIELD INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED A PINHOLE IN A GIRTH WELD AT MP 68.42.  ONCE THE LINE WAS EXCAVATED, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS PINHOLE IN THE GIRTH WELD WAS LIKELY SEEPING PRIOR TO THE TEST.  THE LOCATION OF THE EXCAVATION IS IN A ROAD CROSSING IDENTIFIED AS SE 50 RD.  THE HYDROSTATIC TEST WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, AFTER WHICH, THE SPECIMEN CONTAINING THE LEAK FEATURE WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH A PIECE OF NEW, PRETESTED PIPE.

THE STORM ALSO CAUSED THE SCADA SYSTEM AT JOHNSONVILLE TO GO INTO PCU SCAN AND FOR THE HIGH TANK ALARM TO GIVE FALSE ALARMS. THE CHARGE PUMP AT JOHNSONVILLE WAS PUMPING OUT APPROXIMATELY 80 BBLS EVERY 2 HOURS. HOWEVER, THE UPSTREAM CLAY CITY PUMP STATION WAS PUMPING APPROXIMATELY 350 BBLS INTO THE JOHNSONVILLE TANK EVERY 2 HOURS. THE CONTROLLER TAKES BARREL COUNTS FROM THE SCADA SYSTEM EVERY 2 HOURS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS GOING INTO A TANK AND WHAT IS GOING OUT OF THAT TANK. THE QUALIFIED CONTROLLER WAS TRAINING A NEW CONTROLLER THAT EVENING. THE TRAINEE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BBLS WERE BEING PUMPED INTO THE TANK AT JOHNSONVILLE THAN WERE BEING PUMPED OUT. THE QUALIFIED CONTROLLER FAILED TO OVERSEE THE TRAINEE'S ACTIONS. WHEN THE TRAINEE'S SHIFT WAS OVER, THE QUALIFIED CONTROLLER WENT TO GET BARREL COUNTS AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE ISSUE. HE SHUT DOWN THE CLAY CITY PUMP THAT WAS PUMPING INTO THE JOHNSONVILLE TANK, CALLED THE LOCAL GAUGER TO GO ON-SITE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION, AND CALLED THE PIPELINE MAINTENANCE MANAGER TO HAVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ON THE WAY. THE GAUGER REPORTED THAT CRUDE OIL WAS OUT, BUT WAS ALL CONTAINED INSIDE THE TANK FIREWALL. THE OIL WAS RECOVERED BY VACUUM TRUCK AND PUT INTO A FRAC TANK THAT HAPPENED TO BE ON SITE FOR OTHER MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. THE RECOVERED OIL WAS THEN PUT BACK INTO THE TANK. NO SOIL CONTAMINATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACCIDENT.  AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

CENTURION PIPELINE'S (CPL) DETAILED INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT A THIRD PARTY LINE STRIKE CAUSED THE LEAK ON THE BENNETT GATHERING TRUNK C 6"" PIPELINE. THE DAMAGE TO THE TOP (12 O'CLOCK POSITION) OF THE PIPE INCLUDES TWO DENTS WITH HOLES THAT RESULTED IN A ONE BARREL LEAK. ADDITIONAL DENTS NEAR THE TWO HOLES INCLUDE VISIBLE DEFLECTION OF THE PIPE, WHICH INDICATES THE PIPE WAS STRUCK. UPON EXAMINING THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE, CPL FOUND TACTILE EVIDENCE OF INDENTIONS WITH METAL LOSS FURTHER SUPPORTING A LINE STRIKE. WHILE REVIEWING HISTORICAL SATELLITE IMAGERY OF THE LEAK LOCATION, CPL IDENTIFIED A PREVIOUS EXCAVATION OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA SURROUNDING THE LEAK LOCATION VISIBLE IN IMAGERY DATED FEBRUARY 26, 2017. CPL FINDS NO RECORD OF EXCAVATION NOTIFICATIONS VIA ONE CALL, OR OTHERWISE, DURING THE TIME PERIOD LEADING UP TO THE EXCAVATION IDENTIFIED IN THE FEBRUARY 2017 SATELLITE IMAGERY.

SINCLAIR DISPATCHED PERSONNEL TO CONFIRM THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK. UPON ARRIVAL AT 07:20 SINCLAIR PERSONNEL CONFIRMED A SMALL LEAK WAS SURFACING IN THE VICINITY OF THE SINCLAIR 6"" PIPE. AMPLIFY HAD ALREADY CALLED OUT A VAC TRUCK AND HYDROVAC TRUCK. ONCE EMERGENCY ONE-CALLS WERE SUBMITTED AND SINCLAIR'S LINE WAS LOCATED THE SITE WAS HYDRO-EXCAVATED AND THE PIPE WAS VISUALLY IDENTIFIED. A TRACK-HOE WAS THEN USED TO EXCAVATE THE SITE. A PINHOLE EXTERNAL CORROSION LEAK WAS OBSERVED - LEAK RATE WAS LESS THAN 1 GALLON PER HOUR. A HALF SOLE PATCH AND U-BOLT REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED ON THE LEAKING PIPE (LEAK CLAMPED AT 10:00) AND THE SITE WAS SECURED UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT PERMANENT REPAIRS CAN BE MADE. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EXTERNAL CORROSION FAILURE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE PIPE-TO-SOIL READING AT THE LEAK LOCATION WAS -1.005. THE PIPE HAD A COMBINATION OF COAL TAR COATING WITH COLD TAPE WRAP IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK. IT WAS NOT EVIDENT WHETHER THE TAPE WRAP WAS DIS-BONDED PRIOR TO THE LEAK OR WHETHER THE LEAKING OIL CAUSED THE TAPE WRAP TO BECOME DIS-BONDED. THE SITE IS CONGESTED AND SHIELDING MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THE SECTION OF PIPE OF UNKNOWN MANUFACTURE WAS REPLACED BY NEW PIPE AND THE NEW FABRICATION WAS LOCATED AS TO AVOID THE CONGESTED AREA. THE REPLACED PIPE WAS EXAMINED TO TRY TO DETERMINE CAUSAL FACTORS TO THE LEAK. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE LEAKING SECTION OF PIPE WAS .156"" WALL PIPE THAT WAS WELDED BETWEEN STANDARD WALL (.280"") PIPE SECTIONS.

USIC LOCATING, INC. PERFORMED ONE-CALL LOCATING FOR THE CITY OF KANSAS CITY, MGE AND OTHER UNDERGROUND FACILITY OWNERS.  USIC MARKED THE PRESENCE OF ONE UNDERGROUND ELECTRICAL LINE FOR THE STREETLIGHTS AND ONE UNDERGROUND GAS LINE ABOUT A FOOT TO THE SOUTH OF THE ELECTRICAL LINE.  HOWEVER, THERE ACTUALLY WERE TWO ELECTRICAL LINES AT THAT LOCATION, NOT ONE, ALONG WITH THE GAS LINE ABOUT A FOOT TO THE SOUTH OF THE TWO ELECTRICAL LINES.  HEARTLAND PERSONNEL DUG ONE POTHOLE BETWEEN THE SINGLE RED BROKEN PAINT LINE FOR ONE ELECTRICAL LINE AND THE SINGLE BROKEN YELLOW PAINT LINE FOR THE GAS LINE MARKED ON THE SURFACE AND FOUND TWO CONDUITS.  HEARTLAND CONCLUDED THEY HAD EXPOSED THE ELECTRICAL LINE AND THE GAS LINE THAT USIC HAD MARKED. IN REALITY, HEARTLAND HAD EXPOSED TWO ELECTRICAL CONDUITS AND HAD NOT EXPOSED THE GAS MAIN.  HEARTLAND THEN DIRECTED THE DRILL TO A DEPTH ABOUT A FOOT BELOW THE CONDUITS AND STRUCK THE GAS MAIN.  HEARTLAND FAILED TO EXTEND THE POTHOLE TO THE DEPTH OF THE PLANNED BORE WHERE THE DRILL COULD BE OBSERVED PASSING BELOW THE CONDUITS. THE GAS LINE WAS STRUCK BETWEEN 16:00 AND 16:30, BUT HEARTLAND PERSONNEL DID NOT NOTIFY EMERGENCY PERSONNEL UNTIL THEY CALLED 911 AT 16:54.  MGE DISPATCH WAS NOTIFIED AT 16:55.      IN REFERENCE TO PART A, QUESTION 16, MGE GAVE EVACUATION ORDERS TO TWO STRUCTURES (906 AND 910 W 48TH STREET) PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.    THE EXPLOSION AT JJ'S RESTAURANT, 910 W. 48TH STREET, KANSAS CITY, MO, OCCURRED AT 18:02. THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE WAS CLOSED AT 19:20. THE TWO-INCH GAS MAIN WAS PINCHED OFF AT THE SE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW AT 20:00. AFTER THE GAS FLOW WAS STOPPED, THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT THE NE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW AND JUST WEST OF THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE. THEN, THE GAS MAIN ON BELLEVIEW WAS RE-ENERGIZED TO ALLOW GAS FLOW TO CUSTOMERS ON BELLEVIEW BETWEEN 48TH AND 47TH STREETS. THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET BETWEEN BELLEVIEW AND ROANOKE IS STILL INACTIVE.    ONE FATALITY AND MULTIPLE INJURIES RESULTED, INCLUDING MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER, AND EMPLOYEES OF HEARTLAND AND JJ'S RESTAURANT. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT THE TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, IN PART BECAUSE LITIGATION CONTINUES INVOLVING THREE BUILDINGS IN THE VICINITY AND ONE ISSUE IN EACH CASE IS THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE EXPLOSION.    MGE HAD SIX EMPLOYEES ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION. AS MGE WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE A FULL INVESTIGATION ON THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF ITS ON-SITE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT, FIVE OF THE SIX EMPLOYEES WERE SENT TO THE HOSPITAL LATER THAT EVENING FOR DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING. THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING FOR ALL FIVE EMPLOYEES. DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO FOUR OF THE EMPLOYEES, WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS. A DRUG TEST WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER AN ALCOHOL TEST TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE, BUT DID NOT. THE SIXTH EMPLOYEE, MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER, WAS TESTED FOR ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AFTER THE INCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF THE TREATMENT FOR HIS INJURIES AT ST.

PGW DISCONNECTED THE SERVICE ADJACENT TO THE MAIN CONNECTION AND INSERTED PLASTIC TO THE FRONT WALL OF THE PROPERTY IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK AND RESTORE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  THE SERVICE CONNECTION TO THE MAIN WAS A STEEL NIPPLE COMING OFF THE SIDE OF A 6' LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN. THIS MAIN CONNECTION REQUIRED THE SERVICES OF A WELDER IN ORDER TO BE PERMANENTLY ABANDONED AND REPLACED WITH A NEW SERVICE TEE.  THE STEEL SERVICE CONNECTION WAS TEMPORARILY WRAPPED WITH WAX-TAPE AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE AND LEFT OVERNIGHT UNTIL A WELDER WAS AVAILABLE.

PDT AND WAS ON SITE AT 10:20 A.M. PDT.  THE NORTHERN LAKES FIRE DISTRICT RESPONDED AND EVACUATED 3 NEARBY RESIDENCES AT 6971, 6997 AND 7025 W CHRISTINE STREET.  THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE REQUIRED SQUEEZING THE 2"" MAIN IN THREE LOCATIONS AS IT WAS CLOSE TO A TEE.  THE SQUEEZES WERE COMPLETE AT 11:43 A.M. PDT TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF GAS.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LEFT ONCE THE SCENE WAS SECURE.  UNDERGROUND BARHOLE READINGS WERE TAKEN IN FRONT OF THE THREE EVACUATED HOUSES AND SHOWED 0 PERCENT LEL.  INSIDE GAS READINGS WERE TAKEN AT 6997 W CHRISTINE STREET AT APPROXIMATELY 12:10 P.M. PDT AND SHOWED READINGS BETWEEN 10% AND 70% LEL.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN EXITED THE HOUSE AND LEFT THE DOORS OPEN TO AIR OUT THE HOUSE.    AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30 P.M. PDT THE HOMEOWNERS AT 7025 W CHRISTINE STREET CAME HOME AND REQUESTED TO ENTER THEIR HOUSE.  A GAS SERVICEMAN CHECKED EACH ROOM OF THE HOUSE WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR AND FOUND READINGS OF 0% LEL, SO THE GAS SERVICEMAN CLEARED THE HOUSE FOR THE HOMEOWNERS TO REENTER.    SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE HOMEOWNERS AT 6997 W CHRISTINE STREET REQUESTED TO GET BACK INTO THEIR HOUSE.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN CHECKED EACH ROOM WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR, WHICH NOW READ 0% LEL AND HE ALLOWED THE HOMEOWNERS BACK IN THEIR HOUSE.  AT THIS TIME, THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY WERE STILL SHUT OFF TO THE HOUSE AND THE ELECTRIC METER HAD TO BE RE-INSTALLED.  AFTER TURNING THE ELECTRICITY BACK ON THE HOMEOWNER REPORTED POPPING NOISES COMING FROM THE FURNACE.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN CHECKED NEAR THE FURNACE AND FOUND 0% LEL AND DECIDED TO TURN THE FURNACE OFF AT THE THERMOSTAT.  WHILE ENTERING THE HOUSE FROM THE GARAGE, THE GAS SERVICEMAN SAW A RED GLOW ABOVE HIS HEAD WHICH WAS AN IGNITION OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 12:46 P.M. PDT.  THE GAS SERVICEMAN EXITED THROUGH THE OPEN GARAGE DOOR AND THE MALE HOMEOWNER EXITED THROUGH THE REAR GARAGE ACCESS DOOR.   INDIVIDUALS ON SCENE THEN HELPED TO GET THE FEMALE HOMEOWNER OUT OF THE UPSTAIRS OF THE HOUSE THROUGH A WINDOW.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE BUILDING WAS CONSUMED BY FLAMES.  OPERATOR PERSONNEL ON SCENE CALLED 911 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE GAS IGNITED AND THE NORTHERN LAKES FIRE DISTRICT WAS ON SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 12:57 P.M. PDT.  THE FEMALE HOMEOWNER WAS ASSESSED BY EMTS ON SITE AND THE MALE HOMEOWNER WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO BE TREATED FOR SECOND DEGREE BURNS ON HIS FOREARM BUT WAS NOT ADMITTED.    PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS A POCKET OF GAS INSIDE THE HOUSE IN A LOCATION THAT COULD NOT BE DETECTED BY THE GAS SERVICEMAN'S INSTRUMENT. IT WAS THAT POCKET OF GAS THAT IGNITED CAUSING THE FIRE.  THE BUILDING WAS DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS WITH A VALUE EXCEEDING $122,000 RESULTING IN THIS INCIDENT BEING REPORTABLE.

GASOLINE ODOR WAS DETECTED IN THE WELL CLOSEST TO THE TANK, BUT NO FREE PRODUCT WAS OBSERVED. THE MONITORING WELLS WERE MONITORED DURING THE TANK EMPTYING PROCESS AND NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT WAS DISCOVERED.  THE TANK HAS BEEN EMPTIED AND CLEANED. AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION COMPANY IS PERFORMING A SCAN OF THE TANK BOTTOM TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE. THE SOURCE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AT THE TIME OF THE SUBMISSION OF THIS REPORT AND THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.    UPDATE: THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE A SMALL CRACK IN THE FLOOR PLATE NEAR THE TANK SHELL. THE DAMAGED FLOOR PLATE SECTION AND PART OF THE SHELL WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT THE WALL LOSS FROM CORROSION ON THE EXTERIOR SECTION SURFACE OF THE FLOOR PLATE (BOTTOMSIDE) HAD THE EFFECT OF INCREASED STRESS ON THE REMAINING STEEL FROM NORMAL SERVICE LOADS WHICH IN TURN ALLOWED LOW CYCLE FATIGUE CRACKING TO OCCUR. THE TANK REPAIR PROCESS IS UNDERWAY.    UPDATE: THE TANK REPAIR PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND COSTS FINALIZED. THE TOTAL VOLUME RELEASED HAS BEEN RECALCULATED AT 8.7 BARRELS. SOIL BORING INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND SOIL SAMPLES WERE SENT FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS. ANALYTICAL SOIL RESULTS INDICATED THAT CONCENTRATIONS OF TARGET CONSTITUENTS OF CONCERN ARE BELOW PADEP APPROVED RISK-BASED SITE SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR MACUNGIE STATION; THEREFORE, NO ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION OR REMEDIATION WILL BE CONDUCTED.

TRANSCANADA EMPLOYEES FROM THE GLGT ST. VINCENT COMPRESSOR STATION NEAR ST. VINCENT, MINNESOTA, RESPONDED TO THE REPORT AND ARRIVED AT THE MLV SITE AT 1:20 PM CDT.  WHEN EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE MLV SITE, THEY OBSERVED THE VALVE SITE TO BE PARTIALLY FLOODED AND GAS BUBBLES TO BE EMANATING FROM NEAR THE BASE OF THE UPSTREAM 20-INCH BLOWDOWN VALVE (1-2-2Y) ON THE 200 LINE PIPELINE.  USE OF A GAS DETECTOR REVEALED LOW LEVELS (APPROXIMATELY 10% LEL) OF GAS NEAR THE LEAK SITE.  THE UPSTREAM  PIPELINE SECTION BETWEEN MLV 1-1-2  TO MLV 1-2-2 WAS THEN SHUT IN AND ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM.  AFTER PUMPING THE FLOODWATER FROM THE VALVE SITE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS ORIGINATING FROM A FILLET WELD ON A 2-INCH WELD-O-LET THAT CONNECTED A 2-INCH POWER GAS LINE TO THE 20-INCH BLOWDOWN RISER.  THE UPSTREAM PIPELINE SECTION WAS THEN BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.      THIS POWER GAS LINE WAS CONNECTED TO THE RISER AT GROUND LEVEL.  BECAUSE THIS CONNECTION WAS SITUATED AT GROUND LEVEL, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT OVER TIME FROST HEAVE PLACED STRESSES ON THE POWER GAS LINE, EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A CRACK ON THE LOWER SIDE OF THE SUBJECT  FILLET WELD AND THE EVENTUAL  LEAK.  BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, THE POWER GAS CONNECTION TO THE DOWNSTREAM BLOWDOWN RISER WAS ALSO INSPECTED, WHICH REVEALED THE COATING TO BE CRACKED ON THE SIMILAR FILLET WELD AS THE UPSTREAM LOCATION.  NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF THIS WELD REVEALED THAT THE WELD WAS NOT CRACKED.  NONE-THE-LESS, BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM POWER GAS CONNECTIONS WOULD BE REPLACED.  AT THIS POINT, THE DOWNSTREAM PIPELINE SECTION BETWEEN MLV 1-2-2 AND MLV 1-3-2 WAS SHUT IN, ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM, AND BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.     IN ADDITION TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER GAS PIPING, SECTIONS OF BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM 20-INCH RISERS WERE REPLACED BECAUSE  THE POWER GAS CONNECTIONS WERE RELOCATED TO MORE SUITABLE LOCATIONS ON THE FACILITY PIPING, MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF ANY FUTURE FROST HEAVE ACTIVITY.

THE GASKET RUPTURED WHILE CRCT OPERATIONS PERSONNEL AND THE REMOTE OPERATIONS CONTROL (ROC), A THIRD PARTY OPERATION COMPANY, WERE CONDUCTING POINT CHECKS ON THE AUTOMATED VALVES AT THE COFFEYVILLE EAST TANK FARM (ETF) FACILITY.  DURING THE START OF THE POINT CHECK PROCESS THE ROC RECEIVED A COPY OF THE FACILITY P&ID'S WHICH IDENTIFIED VALVES USING A DIFFERENT NOMENCLATURE FROM WHAT MOST CRCT OPERATIONS PERSONNEL USE AT THE ETF.  ROC PERSONNEL ASKED FOR APPROVAL TO OPERATE VALVE V-201F WHICH IS KNOWN AS 22A-1 FILL VALVE BY CRCT OPERATIONS PERSONNEL.  THIS VALVE IS LOCATED ON A MANIFOLD SYSTEM CONTAINING THREE VALVES WITH EACH VALVE SPECIFIC TO FILLING ONE OF THREE FACILITY CRUDE OIL STORAGE TANKS.  WHEN CRCT PERSONNEL ACKNOWLEDGED APPROVAL FOR THE ROC TO POINT CHECK VALVE V-201F, THE ROC WAS NOT AWARE THIS WAS THE ACTIVE VALVE FILLING TANK 22A-1 AND CRCT PERSONNEL DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE REQUEST AS THE 22A-1 FILL VALVE.  AS THE VALVE BEGAN TO TRAVEL TO THE CLOSED POSITION, CRCT OPERATIONS PERSONNEL REALIZED THIS WAS THE INCORRECT VALVE AND REQUESTED THE ROC TO REVERSE THE VALVE TRAVEL TO PREVENT SHUTTING IN THE PIPELINE.  THE ROC COULD NOT REVERSE THE TRAVEL UNTIL IT COMPLETELY CYCLED TO THE CLOSED POSITION.  THIS VALVE CLOSURE RESULTED IN A PRESSURE INCREASE AT THE MANIFOLD CONTAINING VALVE V-201F.  THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE RESULTED IN A PUMP SHUT DOWN, HOWEVER THE GASKET RUPTURED ON THE PIPING MANIFOLD RELEASING CRUDE OIL.

THE BATTERY CHARGER THAT WAS SPIKING HIGH TOOK OVER THE LOAD AND THEN FAULTED LOW RESULTING IN A LOW 24VDC SUPPLY TO THE CONTROL PANEL.     THE LOW VOLTAGE AT THE CONTROL PANEL RESULTED IN VARIOUS DIGITAL INPUT AND OUTPUT CARDS TO FAIL WHICH RESULTED IN THE ESD EVENT.  ALTHOUGH THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES INDICATED CLOSED, THE DISCHARGE VALVE DID NOT FULLY CLOSE AND HAD TO BE MANUALLY ACTUATED TO FULLY CLOSE.  THE CLOSED STATUS, WHICH DROPS THE OUTPUT TO THE VALVE, WAS AN INACCURATE INDICATION CREATED DUE TO THE LOW VOLTAGE SUPPLYING THAT DIGITAL INPUT CARD.    GAS CONTROL DISPATCHED FIELD PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE THE STATION SHUTDOWN AND WHEN PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE, THEY DISCOVERED THAT GAS WAS STILL VENTING FROM THE STATION VENT VALVE.

LIMA OPERATOR INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT ULSD HAD BEEN RELEASING FROM A CRACK AT THE BASE OF THE T410 DEEP WELL BOOSTER.  THE TANK SHELL VALVE WAS SAFELY ISOLATED AND NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE OPERATIONS MANAGER AND LOCAL CREW.  BASED ON CALCULATIONS OF THE TANK GAUGE DEVIATION, RELEASE VOLUME ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 150 BARRELS OF ULSD.  INITIAL INSPECTION INDICATES THAT ALL PRODUCT HAS BEEN CONTAINED ON SITE INSIDE SHARED TANK DIKE, AND THE TANK SHELL VALVE CLOSURE HAS STOPPED THE RELEASE OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCT.  CLEAN UP EFFORTS ARE ON GOING AT THIS TIME.  AFTER EXAMINING THE FAILED PUMP, IT IS CLEAR THAT WATER INTRUSION LED TO ICE EXPANSION BETWEEN THE WELL AND THE CAN OF THE DEEP WELL PUMP, CAUSING THE FLANGE TO FAIL.    3/21/2017  UPON REMOVAL OF TANK 410 DEEP WELL PUMP AND CAN, THERE WAS AN ICE RING ON THE INSIDE CAVITY OF THE CAN APPROXIMATELY 1 3/4 INCHES THICK.  THE ROTATING ELEMENT WAS ATTACHED TO THE INNER CAVITY USING STUDS THROUGH THE ROTATING ELEMENT AND TAPPED INTO THE INNER CAVITY BASE PLATE.  INSPECTION OF THE OUTER CAVITY WALLS SHOWED RUST AND WATER MARKS CAUSED FROM THE THREADED STUDS BEING TURNED INTO THE BASE PLATE ACTING AS A JACKING BOLT THAT CREATED A GAP BETWEEN THE GASKET AND THE TWO PLATES.  WATER INTRUSION OCCURRED BETWEEN THE TWO FACES WHICH LEAD TO ICE FORMING BETWEEN THE INNER CAN AND THE WELL OF THE PUMP.  DUE TO A LOW TEMPERATURE OF 3 DEGREES, ICE EXPANSION RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL STRESSES THAT RESULTED IN THE FLANGE BREAKING AT THE BASE OF THE PUMP.    6/5/2017  REMEDIATION OF THE AFFECTED AREA WAS COMPLETED BY REMOVING ALL OF THE AFFECTED SOIL AND STONE FOR DISPOSAL.  A TOTAL OF (5) 20 YARD ROLL-OFF CONTAINERS WITH LINERS WERE REMOVED FROM THE FACILITY.  THE SURFACE WATER REMEDIATION WAS COMPLETED BY REMOVING A TOTAL OF 27,000 GALLONS OF PETROLEUM CONTACT WATER FROM THE RETENTION POND ON SITE FOR DISPOSAL.

DEU SENT A TECHNICIAN TO THE SITE. UPON ARRIVAL THE TECHNICIAN NOTED THAT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HOME. THE METER WAS NOT ACCESSIBLE SO OUR TECHNICIAN TOOK MEASURES TO CUT AND CAP THE SERVICE LINE TO SECURE THE GAS SERVICE.  THE MAIN AND SERVICE LINE WERE LEAK DETECTED AND NO GAS WAS DETECTED. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE HOME'S LOCATION AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES, THE STATE FIRE INVESTIGATOR CHOSE TO LET THE FIRE BURN. THE HOME WAS A TOTAL LOSS (ESTIMATED $200K).    AN EYE WITNESS STATED TO DEU EMPLOYEES THAT WHEN HE ARRIVED THE FIRE APPEARED TO BE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE HOME. WITNESS WENT TO THE NORTH SIDE WITH THE INTENTION OF SHUTTING OFF THE GAS METER AS A PRECAUTION.  WITNESS STATED FLAMES WERE ROLLING OUT OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOME AT THAT TIME AND IT WAS TOO HOT TO GET TO THE METER.  WITNESS WAS UNABLE TO SHUT THE VALVE OFF.  DEU EMPLOYEE ASKED IF AT THE TIME THE WITNESS WAS TRYING TO SHUT OF THE GAS, WHETHER OR NOT THE METER WAS INVOLVED IN THE FIRE.  WITNESS STATED THERE WAS NO FIRE AT THE METER.  WITNESS STATED THERE WAS NO FIRE NEAR THE METER UNTIL AFTER THE NORTH WALL OF THE HOME FELL ON THE METER.     DEU PRESSURE TESTED THE BURIED SERVICE LINE AFTER THE FIRE WAS OUT. THE TEST PASSED.

A SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT WAS SUBMITTED ON 7/30/21 TO CORRECT APPARENT CAUSE AND PROVIDE A NARRATIVE OF ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION FINDINGS . FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE VALVE INDICATED NO METALLURGICAL ISSUES AND ANALYSIS OF LIQUID SAMPLES DID NOT SHOW A CORROSIVE PRODUCT, SO FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED. TWO CORROSION CONTROL SERVICE COMPANIES WERE CONTRACTED TO INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATE THE CP SYSTEMS AT DIVIDE STATION TO DETERMINE IF THE FAILURE WAS CORROSION RELATED.  DIVIDE STATION HAS A 20,000 BBL BREAKOUT TANK, 55,000 BBL BREAKOUT TANK AND ASSOCIATED PUMPS AND STATION PIPING. EACH BREAKOUT TANK HAS AN INDEPENDENT CP SYSTEM CONSISTING OF TI RIBBON ANODES, REFERENCE CELLS AND A RECTIFIER TO PROTECT THE TANK BOTTOM. THE STATION PIPING IS PROTECTED BY A SEPARATE CP SYSTEM CONSISTING OF A DEEP ANODE GROUND BED AND RECTIFIER. THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT THE FLANGED CONNECTION OF THE 12"" VALVE AND A SHORT PIECE OF PIPING THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE TANK NOZZLE AT THE OTHER END.  THIS FLANGED CONNECTION IS ALSO AN ELECTRICAL ISOLATION POINT BETWEEN THE TANK AND THE STATION CP SYSTEMS.  THE PUP OF PIPING AND THE NOZZLE ARE INTERNALLY COATED.  THE VALVE HAS NO INTERNAL COATING. THERE WAS A SLUDGE OF PRODUCT THAT HAD COLLECTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALVE AND TANK PIPING CONNECTION THAT WAS COMPRISED OF AN OIL AND WATER MIXTURE.  THE WATER COMPONENT TO THE PRODUCT ACTED AS A LOW RESISTIVITY ELECTROLYTE AND ALLOWED STRAY CURRENT TO BYPASS THE ISOLATION KIT THROUGH THE PRODUCT AND CAUSE INTERNAL CORROSION OF THE VALVE FLANGE AT THE FLANGED CONNECTION.  BOTH THIRD PARTY CORROSION SERVICE COMPANIES REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY WHAT WAS DEEMED INTERNAL CURRENT TRANSFER.  CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN TO INTEGRATE THE THREE SEPARATE CP SYSTEMS INTO ONE CP SYSTEM.  LESSONS LEARNED AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED AT SUMMIT'S OTHER FACILITY, EPPING STATION, IN THE POLAR DIVIDE SYSTEM WHERE A SIMILAR CP SYSTEM DESIGN WAS IN PLACE WITH A 20,000 BBL TANK, PUMPS AND STATION PIPING.",2270.0,0.0,285.0,5.087719298245614,0.0,0.0,0.0,-8.5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE COPPER LOCATING WIRE INSTALLED ADJACENT TO THE 2-INCH PLASTIC GAS MAIN BECAME ENERGIZED, GENERATING INTENSE LOCALIZED HEAT WHICH MELTED THE PLASTIC.  NATURAL GAS AT APPROX 52 PSIG WAS RELEASED AND WAS IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE, ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN SPECULATED THAT THE ARCING ELECTRIC CONDUCTOR WAS THE SOURCE.  A MICHCON CREW RESPONDED BY PINCHING THE 2-INCH PLASTIC PIPE UPSTREAM OF THE RUPTURE, STOPPING THE LEAK AND INTERRUPTING SERVICE TO 38 CUSTOMERS.  THE LEAKING MAIN WAS REPAIRED USING A 60-INCH LENGTH OF PRE-TESTED POLYETHYLENE PLASTIC.  AN AIR TEST AT 54 PSIG WAS APPLIED TO THE MAIN AND SERVICE LINES DOWNSTREAM OF THE PINCH, BUT THE TEST DID NOT HOLD AND THE DEAD-END SYSTEM TO THE SOUTH OF THE PINCH REMAINED OUT OF SERVICE.    A LEAK SURVEY OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UPSTREAM OF THE PINCH FOUND LEAKS AT ANOTHER 20 LOCATIONS, SOME NEARLY 2 MILES FROM THE ORIGINAL MAIN LEAK AT 866 SCENIC DRIVE.  ARC BURNS AND PERFORATIONS OF POLYETHYLENE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE TUBING WERE FOUND ALONG SCENIC DRIVE, ON WEST GILES ROAD AS FAR EAST AS 4175 W GILES, AND NORTH OF W GILES AT 1680 BENJAMIN ROAD IN LAKETON TOWNSHIP.  ALL 20 LEAKS WERE ELIMINATED BY REPLACEMENT OF VARIOUS LENGTHS OF NEW SERVICE LINE TUBING.  THE EVENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 18:59 ON OCTOBER 18, 2012, WHEN MICHCON REALIZED THE COST OF REPAIRS ALREADY MADE AND OTHER LEAKS THAT MAY HAVE REMAINED TO BE FOUND AND REPAIRED WOULD LIKELY EXCEED THE THRESHOLD FOR REPORTING AS AN INCIDENT.   ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2012, MICHCON RE-ESTABLISHED GAS SERVICE TO THE MAINS AND SERVICE LINES SOUTH (DOWNSTREAM) OF THE PINCH ALONG SCENIC DRIVE AND FENNER ROAD.  THE MAINS AND SERVICE LINES WERE SURVEYED FOR LEAKS; EIGHT MORE LEAKS WERE FOUND AND REPAIRED.

NPA STATION IS LOCATED WITHIN THE ENTERPRISE TANK FARM FACILITY.  THE OPERATOR NOTIFIED THE COLONIAL LEAD OPERATOR WHO DISPATCHED PERSONNEL TO NPA TO INVESTIGATE. INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE AND ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE DEPLOYED TO THE SITE TO ASSIST WITH THE INVESTIGATION. AT 00:10 ON 8/14/16 IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT COLONIAL'S NPA FACILITY WAS MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THE PRODUCT RELEASE WHEN PRODUCT WAS OBSERVED IN ACCESS WELLS INSIDE THE STATION. RESPONSE ACTIVITIES WERE IMMEDIATELY INITIATED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL ENTERPRISE PERSONNEL AT 00:30. LINE 2PA HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN FOLLOWING A SCHEDULED OPERATION AT 12:33 ON 8/13/16 AND WAS STILL DOWN AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY. HEAVY THUNDERSTORMS AND RAIN BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 17:00 AND 20:00 ON 8/13/16 HAD DROPPED A REPORTED 2.44 INCHES IN THE AREA. CLEANUP AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES WERE INITIATED AT 01:50 WHEN OSROS ARRIVED ON SCENE AND BEGAN TO ESTABLISH CONTAINMENT ZONES AND PRODUCT RECOVERY POINTS. PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES WERE ALSO TAKEN TO PROTECT AREA DRAINAGE DITCHES AND A CANAL. THE NPA LINE 2 INJECTION VALVE WAS POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE AT 18:15 ON 8/14/16.  THE NPA LINE 2 INJECTION VALVE IS AN SPX/M&J 36 INCH COMPACT EXPANDING GATE VALVE, ANSI 300.  THE VALVE CONSTRUCTION INCLUDES A 2 PIECE VALVE SLAB WITH A GUIDE RAIL ASSEMBLY THAT CONNECTS TO THE SLAB ON BOTH SIDES.  THIS GUIDE RAIL ASSEMBLY TRAVELS ALONG A GUIDE PLUG ON EACH SIDE INSIDE THE VALVE BODY.  THE GUIDE PLUG PROTRUDES INSIDE THE VALVE BODY AND IS AFFIXED TO THE SIDE OF THE VALVE BODY EXTERNALLY WITH A FLANGE AND SIX 0.5 INCH B7 STUDS AND NUTS. ON 8/14/2016, AT 18:15, THE STUDS ON ONE OF THE GUIDE PLUG FLANGE ASSEMBLIES WERE FOUND TO BE LOOSE. NO PRODUCT WAS OBSERVED COMING FROM THIS FLANGE ASSEMBLY WITH THE VALVE IN THE CLOSED POSITION. INITIAL REPAIR WAS CONSIDERED TO BE COMPLETED WHEN THE GUIDE PLUG FLANGE BOLTS WERE REPLACED ONE BY ONE AND TORQUED TO SPECIFICATION AS OF 21:45 ON 8/14/16. THE NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE AT 02:18 ON 8/14/2016 BASED ON A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE RESPONSE COSTS WOULD EXCEED $50,000. THE TEXAS STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER WAS NOTIFIED AT 04:53 ON 8/14/16 FOR TCEQ PURPOSES BASED ON A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE RELEASE VOLUME WOULD EXCEED 5 BARRELS IN A 24 HOUR PERIOD. THE TEXAS STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER WAS NOTIFIED AGAIN AT 09:18 ON 8/14/16 FOR TGLO AND TCEQ PURPOSES WHEN COLONIAL IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO DEPLOY DEFENSIVE BOOM IN THE LOCAL DRAINAGE DISTRICT 7 (DD7) CANAL ADJACENT TO THE ENTERPRISE TANK FARM. COURTESY CALLS WERE MADE TO PHMSA SOUTHERN REGION (CHRIS TAYLOR) AT 10:16 AND TO PHMSA SOUTHWEST REGION (MARY MCDANIEL) AT 10:16 ON 8/14/16 AS A FOLLOW UP TO THE NRC NOTIFICATION.   UPDATE: DURING THE FUNCTION TEST FOLLOWING THE GUIDE PLUG REPLACEMENT, A MALFUNCTION OCCURRED INSIDE THE VALVE WHICH SHEARED THE BOLTS AND FORCED THE GUIDE PLUG OUT OF THE VALVE BODY, RESULTING IN A SEPARATE REPORTABLE PRODUCT RELEASE (REFERENCE 20160299-21695). A SUBSEQUENT REPAIR PLAN WAS DEVELOPED WHICH CONSISTED OF REPLACING ALL THE INTERNAL WORKINGS OF THE VALVE, NEW SLAB, GUIDE ARMS, GUIDE PLUGS, ETC. FINAL REPAIRS TO THE VALVE, VALVE BODY PRESSURE TEST AND OPEN/CLOSE FUNCTION TEST WERE COMPLETED AS OF 16:42 ON 8/17/16.  LINE WAS RESTARTED AND RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION AS OF 18:38 ON 8/17/16. THE INCIDENT ANALYSIS REPORT, APPROVED ON 3/8/17, PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS:   1. THE ACTUATOR AND HYDRAULIC POWER SYSTEM WERE OVERSIZED (MISMATCHED) FOR THE VALVE, APPLYING EXCESSIVE THRUST WHEN CLOSING WHICH DAMAGED THE INTERNAL MECHANISMS OF THE VALVE.  2. THE VALVE WAS CLOSING AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED THAN RECOMMENDED BY THE MANUFACTURER'S ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION (15 SECONDS VERSUS 30 SECONDS TO TRANSITION).    SUPP.

THE CONTROLLER IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED AND SHUT DOWN THE LINE. THE RELEASE WAS LOCATED BY A PIPELINER AT 02:55 AM CST IN PALOS HEIGHTS, COOK COUNTY, IL. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES WERE INITIATED AND ALL LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WERE CONTACTED. EXCAVATION REVEALED A SPLIT NEAR A SEAM (ERW) ON THE PIPE. ON AUGUST 31, THE OLD SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED AND A NEW SECTION WAS INSTALLED.    PRESSURE HOLD TESTS WERE SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED ON SEPTEMBER 14 AND 15. THE LINE WAS RESTARTED ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2012. AFTER THE REFILL WAS COMPLETED, THE OUTAGE WAS DETERMINED TO BE 704 BARRELS OF JET FUEL. REMEDIATION EFFORTS ARE ONGOING. THE AFFECTED PORTION OF THE PIPE HAS BEEN SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.    APPROXIMATELY 9 BARRELS OF JET FUEL REACHED THE NEARBY CALUMET SAG CHANNEL ON AUGUST 27, 2012. THE CHANNEL WAS CLOSED AND THE BARRELS WERE RECOVERED. THE CHANNEL WAS REOPENED ON AUGUST 28, 2012.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:  *BBLS RECOVERED UPDATED TO 685.  *PART E UPDATED TO SHOW THAT A CONTROL ROOM ISSUE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELEASE.  *INDEPENDENT METALLURGICAL TESTING AND ANALYSIS ON THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE TESTING AND ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED ALONG THE LONG SEAM WELD IN AN AREA WITH REDUCED WALL THICKNESS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION. THE AREAS OF EXTERNAL CORROSION ON THE PIPE CORRESPONDED TO AREAS OF COATING DISBONDMENT ALONG THE 9:00 ORIENTATION AND 3:00 ORIENTATION OF THE 16 DEGREE BEND IN THE PIPE AT THE FAILURE LOCATION. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF PREFERENTIAL CORROSION AT THE LONG SEAM WELD (GROOVING CORROSION) AT THE ORIGIN OF THE FAILURE. HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH CORROSION ALSO WERE FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE PIPE NEAR THE FAILURE, SUGGESTING THAT THEY MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE FAILURE.

CONTROL CENTER CONTACTED LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANNING COMMITTEE TO ALERT OF A POSSIBLE RELEASE. LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE AWARE OF THE RELEASE AND PROVIDED LOCATION INFORMATION. CONTROL CENTER THEN CONTACTED LOCAL OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE AREA. THE LEAK OCCURRED NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF NW 164TH ST. AND NORTH PENN AVE NEAR EDMOND, OK, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 13 MILES DOWNSTREAM OF THE NOBLE PUMP STATION.  AFTER ARRIVAL, OPERATING PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVES UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE FAILURE. UPON ARRIVING AT THE RELEASE LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 17:30, LOCAL OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT DETERMINED AT APPROXIMATELY 18:15 THAT DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE RELEASE, REPAIR AND ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION COSTS WOULD EXCEED $50,000. NRC WAS THEN CONTACTED AND REPORT 1211819 WAS ISSUED. ON MAY 11, THE REQUIRED 48 HOUR UPDATE CALL WAS PLACED TO NRC. VOLUME RELEASED WAS UPDATED TO 15 BBLS AND REPORT 1211901 WAS ISSUED.    CONTROL CENTER REVIEW OF SCADA DATA INDICATES THAT THE RELEASE MAY HAVE BEGUN AT APPROXIMATELY 16:04. LEAKWARN SYSTEM WAS OPERATING AT THE TIME BUT NOT FUNCTIONAL TO THE CONSOLE DUE TO ROUTINE MAINTENANCE BEGINNING AT 15:45. SCADA INDICATIONS OF A RELEASE MAY HAVE BEEN MASKED BY THE STARTUP OF A DOWNSTREAM INJECTION POINT AT 15:47. LEAKWARN WAS RETURNED TO THE CONSOLE AT 16:27. FIRST LEAKWARN IMBALANCE WARNING ALARM WAS AT 16:39 AND THE SR IMBALANCE ALARM WAS AT 16:42 AND REVIEWED BY CONTROLLER AND THEN LINE WAS SHUTDOWN AT 16:44.    RESULTS OF THE IN-FIELD VISUAL ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT THE 12 O'CLOCK ORIENTATION IN AN AREA OF EXTERNAL CORROSION APPROXIMATELY 10"" X 1.5"". COATING DAMAGE AND POSSIBLE MECHANICAL DAMAGE WERE ALSO VISIBLE IN THE FAILED AREA. REVIEW OF CATHODIC PROTECTION DATA INDICATES THIS AREA WAS LIKELY SUBJECT TO LOCAL STRAY CURRENT INTERFERENCE LEADING TO A LOCALIZED ACCELERATED EXTERNAL CORROSION GROWTH RATE. THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE WAS THEN PRESERVED AND SHIPPED TO DET NORSKE VERITAS USA (DNV), WHO WILL PERFORM METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE.    IN 2015, A HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE LINER (HDPE) APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN CRUDE OIL SERVICE WAS INSTALLED IN THIS PIPELINE TO PREVENT DEGRADATION OF THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE STEEL PIPE VIA INTERNAL CORROSION. TO DETERMINE THAT THIS LINER HAD NOT BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE, A COMPANY METALLURGICAL ENGINEER EXAMINED THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE. THIS EXAMINATION CONCLUDED THAT THE STEEL FAILED AT AN AREA OF EXTERNAL CORROSION AND COATING DAMAGE, WHICH HAD CAUSED THE LINER UNDERNEATH TO BULGE. AS A RESULT, THE LINER WAS PIERCED BY THE SHARP EDGES OF THE CORRODED STEEL PIPE.    REPAIR INCLUDED REPLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 2,000' OF PIPE AND INTERNAL LINER. THE REPLACEMENT PIPE WAS HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED AND A NEW LINER WAS THEN INSTALLED. AFTER LINER INSTALLATION, THE SEGMENT OF PIPE WAS AGAIN HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED. UPON REPAIR COMPLETION THE PIPELINE WAS RESTARTED ON MAY 26, WITH REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL.    DNV METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK OCCURRED IN AN AREA OF THROUGH WALL, EXTERNAL CORROSION PITS WHICH WERE ALIGNED WITH AN AREA OF TOP SIDE MECHANICAL DAMAGE, IN THE FORM OF A GOUGE.  THE ALIGNED CORROSION PITS RESULTED IN A WIDE THROUGH WALL FLAW.  THE INTERNAL LINER BULGED PRIOR TO THE FAILURE AND THE SHARP EDGES OF THE CORRODED PIPE TORE THE LINER WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE LEAK.      FURTHER ANALYSIS OF CATHODIC PROTECTION DATA CONFIRMED THIS AREA WAS SUBJECT TO LOCAL STRAY CURRENT INTERFERENCE WHICH CAUSED AN ACCELERATED CORROSION GROWTH RATE AT THE FAILURE POINT.

THE NGL TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE HOUSTON CONTROL CENTER TO SHUT DOWN THE RED BLUFF LATERAL AND THE OPERATIONS TEAM WAS ALSO NOTIFIED. NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE NRC AND TXRRC.  THE OPERATION TEAM THEN TRIED TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE LEAK. AFTER THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATING, THE LEAK WAS IDENTIFIED.  BOOMS WERE LATER DEPLOYED AND WATER SAMPLES WERE ALSO TAKEN AS THE TEAM BEGAN EFFORTS TO REPLACE THE LEAKING PIPELINE AND MITIGATE THE AFFECTED AREA. THE BORE SECTION OF THE PECOS RIVER WAS REMOVED, REPLACED WITH A NEW BORE SECTION AND A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 3232 FEET WAS HYDROSATICALLY TESTED INCLUDING THE NEW BORE. A SAMPLE OF THE REMOVED PIPE WAS SENT TO A 3RD PARTY ENGINEERING FIRM TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE. WHILE WAITING FOR THE REPORT DCP HAS INITIATED ADDITIONAL CORROSION MITIGATION EFFORTS.     THE DRAFT REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE THIRD PARTY ENGINEERING FIRM INDICATED THE ROOT CAUSE OF FAILURE WAS DUE TO STRAY CURRENT CORROSION (AC AND DC INDUCED CORROSION). LOCATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED ALONG THE PIPELINE SEGMENT THAT POTENTIALLY HAD SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO THE PECOS RIVER CROSSING, FOCUSING ON FOREIGN LINE CROSSINGS, ROAD AND RIVER/STREAM CROSSINGS AND AC POWER CORRIDORS AS AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONCERN. DCP MIDSTREAM COMPLETED A TOTAL OF 31 EXCAVATIONS, NONE OF WHICH REVEALED ANY PRESSURE REDUCING ANOMALIES. FIELD INVESTIGATION OF THE ANOMALIES INDICATED THAT ONLY RECOATING WAS REQUIRED, HOWEVER, DCP MIDSTREAM DID DECIDE TO UTILIZE A COMPOSITE WRAP ON ONE (1) OF THE ANOMALIES.    DCP RETURNED TO PIPELINE TO SERVICE ON 8/26/2016 AT A 20% PRESSURE REDUCTION WHILE ADDITIONAL MITIGATIVE MEASURES WERE TAKEN. DCP MIDSTREAM IMPLEMENTED THE FOLLOWING MEASURES WHICH INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW GROUND BED NEAR THE PECOS RIVER, BONDS WITH SELECT ADJACENT PIPELINES AS WELL AS THE INSTALLATION OF ZINC RIBBONS AND DECOUPLERS IN AREAS DEEMED AT HIGHER RISK FROM AC STRAY CURRENT. ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED INCLUDE CONDUCTING A FULL PIPELINE CLOSE INTERVAL AND DCVG SURVEY AND THE INSTALLATION OF ONE NEW REMOTE MONITORING TEST STATION FOR ONCE PER WEEK READINGS (AC/DC) NEAR THE PECOS RIVER.    DCP RAN A HIGH-RESOLUTION MFL ILI TOOL TO VERIFY AND VALIDATE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPELINE. THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS DETERMINED THERE WERE NO ANOMALIES SATISFYING THE ""IMMEDIATE CONDITION"" CRITERIA OUTLINED IN 49 CFR 195.452(H). THE SIX (6) DEEPEST METAL LOSS ANOMALIES WERE PROVIDED BY THE ILI VENDOR. DCP SELECTED THE SIX (6) WORST ANOMALIES TO BE EXCAVATED TO VALIDATE THE TOOL RUN BUT THE SAFE PRESSURE CALCULATIONS ON THE IDENTIFIED ANOMALIES WERE WELL ABOVE MOP. ONE OF THE EXCAVATED ANOMALIES WAS FOUND TO HAVE A PINHOLE LEAK AFTER EXCAVATION. STOPPLES WERE INSTALLED AND THE ANOMALY WAS CUT OUT. TWO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE REPAIRED WITH TYPE B SLEEVES, ONE ANOMALY WAS REPAIRED WITH A COMPOSITE WRAP, AND THE OTHER ANOMALIES WERE RECOATED.

LINE 400 WAS INSTALLED IN 1952 AND IS APPROXIMATELY 35.1 MILES FROM FENTON INTERCHANGE IN FENTON, MICHIGAN TO LAINGSBURG INTERCHANGE IN LAINGSBURG, MICHIGAN.    INVESTIGATION AND ROOT CAUSE SUMMARY    AFTER THE ONSITE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED, THE PIPELINE FRAGMENTS WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE CONSUMERS ENERGY LABORATORY FOR A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. ADDITIONALLY, A THOROUGH PIPELINE HISTORY REVIEW, INCLUDING PREVIOUS INLINE INSPECTION RESULTS, WAS PERFORMED ALONG WITH A FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS (FEA) AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKING THROUGH THE AMERICAN GAS ASSOCIATION (AGA). THE COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED CONSUMERS ENERGY'S LINE 400 PIPELINE WAS A RESULT OF AN OVERSTRESS CONDITION OF THE 24-INCH PIPELINE DURING THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL MAGNETIC FLUX LEAKAGE (CMFL) INSPECTION.     A DYNAMIC OVERSTRESS OF THE LINE 400 PIPELINE OCCURRED DURING THE CMFL INLINE INSPECTION DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF STRESS ON THE LINE WHICH RESULTED IN THE INITIATION OF A LEAK AND A SUBSEQUENT RUPTURE.    CONSUMERS ENERGY'S MANAGEMENTS SYSTEM AND CONTROLS FOR INLINE INSPECTION OPERATIONS DID NOT REQUIRE A HAZARD ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE THE COMBINE EFFECTS OF PIPELINE MATERIAL PROPERTIES, PIPELINE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, AND THE WEIGHT, VELOCITY, AND DESIGN OF THE INSPECTION TOOL. THE ABSENCE OF CONTROLS LED TO THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE ADVERSE CONDITIONS TO PIPELINE INTEGRITY WHICH CAUSED THE NATURAL GAS RELEASE AND SUBSEQUENT PIPELINE RUPTURE THAT IMPACTED PIPELINE OPERATIONS, INTEGRITY INSPECTIONS AND RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REMEDIATION COSTS.    INLINE INSPECTION OPERATIONS WERE TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUED ON MARCH 16, 2022, BECAUSE OF THIS EVENT AND DID NOT RESUME UNTIL SEPTEMBER 14, 2022, WHEN THE DIRECT AND ROOT CAUSES WERE IDENTIFIED AND ""SAFE PIGGING OPERATIONS"" COUNTERMEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED.

TO-DATE, THE RELEASE IS CONFIRMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 450 BARRELS WITH NO RETURN OF PRODUCT TO THE SYSTEM.  THE DISCREPANCY IN THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT RELEASED WAS DUE TO FIRST RESPONDER NOT BEING ABLE TO SAFELY ASSESS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM FROM HIS ORIGINAL VANTAGE POINT.

DURING THE DAY, OPERATIONS WAS WORKING WITH THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER TO INSPECT UNIT #2 VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVE (VFD) FOR THE PRIMARY DRIVER/ELECTRIC MOTOR.  DURING THE INSPECTION, ONLY THE POWER TO THE VFD HAD BEEN LOCKED OUT AND NOTHING WAS TOUCHED ON THE GAS PIPING.  AT APPROXIMATELY 2:10 PM MT, OPERATIONS STARTED UNIT #2 AT THE ROBERSON CREEK COMPRESSOR STATION TO CHECK THE OPERATION OF THE VFD.  AFTER OPERATING THE UNIT FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES THE UNIT WAS SHUT DOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 2:20 PM MT BY LOCAL OPERATIONS. EACH TIME A UNIT SHUTS DOWN, A TWO HOUR TIMER STARTS TO BLOWDOWN THE COMPRESSOR CASE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 PM MT, KM PERSONNEL LEFT FOR THE DAY. AT 4:26 PM MT, THE UNIT VENT VALVE OPENED TO VENT THE COMPRESSOR CASE. NORMALLY IN THIS SITUATION, THE UNIT DISCHARGE VALVE WOULD BE IN THE CLOSED POSITION; HOWEVER, THE DISCHARGE VALVE WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION. THIS ALLOWED GAS TO CONTINUE TO VENT FROM THE STATION DISCHARGE. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, AT APPROXIMATELY 6:50 AM MT, STATION PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE FACILITY, HEARD THE GAS BLOWING AND CLOSED THE VENT VALVE THAT THEY FOUND IN THE OPEN POSITION. GAS LOSS WAS CALCULATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 150 MMCF.     THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE UNIT DISCHARGE VALVE WAS COMMANDED OPEN BY THE UNIT PLC AT 2:25PM.  IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED WHY THE VALVE WAS COMMANDED OPEN OR WHERE THE COMMAND CAME FROM. THE INVESTIGATION TEAM WAS UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION AND SUSPECTS THAT THE PLC EXPERIENCED A MALFUNCTION THAT CAUSED IT TO SEND THE UNINTENDED SIGNAL TO OPEN. THE INVESTIGATION ALSO REVEALED THAT THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE PLC PROGRAMMING. THERE WAS A LOGIC PATH THAT ALLOWED THE CONFIRMATION OF THE UNIT VALVE CLOSURES TO BE BYPASSED WHEN BLOWING DOWN THE COMPRESSOR UNIT. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A REOCCURRENCE, THE PLC LOGIC WAS MODIFIED TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIT SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES ARE CLOSED BEFORE THE UNIT VENT VALVE IS OPENED. ADDITIONALLY, CIG ASSESSED THE PLC LOGIC OF THE OTHER TWO COMPRESSOR UNITS AND MADE CHANGES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, A CALLOUT ALARM WAS ADDED IN THE EVENT THAT UNIT VENT VALVE IS OPEN AT THE SAME TIME AS A UNIT SUCTION OR DISCHARGE VALVE.

PERKINS 5 (PERKINS #5) GAS STORAGE WELL IN HARRISON COUNTY NEAR LACONIA, INDIANA, RESULTING IN A UNCONTROLLED NATURAL GAS RELEASE. AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE, A COMPANY CONTRACTOR CREW WAS INSTALLING AN UNDERGROUND PIPELINE DRIP.  THE WELL CASING FAILURE OCCURRED AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABOVE GROUND CASING COLLAR. THE FAILURE DID NOT CAUSE ANY INJURIES OR SIGNIFICANT THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE. NO IGNITION OF GAS OR LIQUIDS OCCURRED DURING THIS EVENT. LG&E IMPLEMENTED ITS EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND THE WELL WAS SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED AND CAPPED ON AUGUST 11, 2020.     DNV GL, A GLOBAL QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT COMPANY, WAS RETAINED TO INVESTIGATE THE WELL CASING FAILURE BY CONDUCTING A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AND FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE LIKELY METALLURGICAL CAUSE(S) AND IDENTIFY ANY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.  A CROSS-FUNCTIONAL INTERNAL TEAM WAS FORMED TO PERFORM AN INCIDENT INVESTIGATION. THE TEAM REVIEWED  GAS STORAGE WELL DOCUMENTATION, DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH PIPELINE DRIP REPLACEMENT, DNVGL METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT AND THE POST INCIDENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE DOCUMENTATION.   THE TEAM ALSO  CONDUCTED WITNESS INTERVIEWS AND PERFORMED A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION TOOK PLACE DURING THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC WHICH LIMITED SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND REQUIRED STRICT PROTOCOLS FOR ANY IN PERSON MEETINGS, INTERVIEWS, AND COLLABORATIONS.      THE  INVESTIGATION ULTIMATELY CONCLUDED THE PRIMARY FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE FAILURE OF PERKINS #5 WAS INADEQUATE OPERATIONAL CONTROLS.  SPECIFICALLY, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WERE UNDERTAKEN WHILE FIELD PIPING WAS CONNECTED TO THE GAS STORAGE WELLHEAD RESULTING IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD STRESSES ON WELL CASING FROM EXTERNAL FORCES LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE PIPELINE DRIP.      THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT BY DNV GL STATED ""THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS  INDICTED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF DUCTILE OVERLOAD FROM A SIGNIFICANT EXTERNAL BENDING OR LONGITUDINAL FORCE, LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH EXCAVATION, AND INSTALLATION OF THE DRIP PIPING"".      THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION FOUND THESE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCIDENT INCLUDED:     A. CONNECTION OF FIELD PIPELINE TO THE WELLHEAD WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION RESULTED IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD AND FAILURE OF THE WELL CASING PIPE.    B. PIPELINE DESIGN DRAWINGS WERE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES THAT PROHIBITED CONNECTION OF FIELD PIPELINE TO THE WELLHEAD WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  C. FIELD PIPELINE DRIP WAS NOT PREFABRICATED IN CONFORMANCE WITH DESIGN DRAWING.  D. DESIGN DRAWINGS DID NOT INCLUDE DETAILED NOTES OR REFERENCES.      D3 - COMPONENT THAT FAILED IS GAS STORAGE WELL CASING, SO PIR DOESN'T APPLY. USED DEFAULT VALUE OF ""1"".  PIR IS NOT APPLICABLE TO STORAGE WELL.

AT APPROXIMATELY 11:10 AM, A WELD BURN THROUGH OCCURRED DURING IN-SERVICE WELDING (AT ~6 OCLOCK POSITION) WHILE IN THE PROCESS OF INSTALLING THE FIRST BUTTER PASS/TEMPER BEAD ON A CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELD FOR THE SLEEVE. A SMALL FIRE ENSUED THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED BY THE TWO FIRE-WATCHES ON SITE. NO INJURIES OCCURRED AND THE LINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN, ISOLATED AND EFFORTS INITIATED TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE SEGMENT. THE PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS ISOLATED AND PURGED AND THE AFFECTED AREA OF PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH NEW PIPE.  THE PIPELINE WAS THEN RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 8:00 AM ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2018.      THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT IS RELATED TO A THIN WALL INTERNAL CORROSION AREA ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE AT THE LOCATION OF THE SLEEVE CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELD THAT WAS NOT IDENTIFIED DURING THE UT TESTING OF THE AREA PRIOR TO WELDING.  THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS IN THIS AREA WAS TOO THIN TO SUPPORT IN-SERVICE WELDING AND SO THE WELD PENETRATED THE PIPE WALL.      AN EPOCH 650 DUAL ELEMENT PROBE WAS USED TO PERFORM THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS TESTING PRIOR TO WELDING OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELDS FOR THE SLEEVE.  WITH THIS TYPE OF UT INSTRUMENT, AND UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF PIPE WALL THICKNESS AND CORROSION GEOMETRY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A FALSE INDICATION OF PIPE WALL THICKNESS THAT IS A MULTIPLE OF THE ACTUAL REMAINING WALL THICKNESS.  IN THIS CASE, THE NDT TECHNICIAN RECEIVED A FALSE THICKNESS UT READING WHICH WAS BELIEVED TO BE ADEQUATE FOR IN-SERVICE WELDING.        P66 IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING IMPROVEMENTS TO UT PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING FALSE THICKNESS INDICATIONS IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS.    BASED ON THESE EVALUATIONS, APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO UT PROCEDURES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.

(R&M) ENTERED THE WEST YARD SECTION OF THE PHILADELPHIA REFINERY AND DISCOVERED A RELEASE OF HEAVY OIL AROUND A VALVE MANIFOLD WHICH CONNECTS THE FM-1 PIPELINE TO THE N-8 PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE NOTIFIED SUNOCO PERSONNEL AND A RESPONSE WAS INITIATED.  THE VACUUM GAS OIL (VGO) TRANSFER WAS SHUTDOWN AT 14:00 HOURS AND, DUE TO THE HIGH VISCOSITY OF THE PRODUCT, THE HEAVY MATERIAL WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPLACED FROM THE PIPELINE WITH LIGHT CYCLE OIL (LCO) AND ISOLATED BY 18:00 HOURS.    ON 4/5/2010, THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN A FLANGED CONNECTION ON THE FM-1 PIG TRAP, NORMALLY ISOLATED, EXCEPT DURING PIGGING ACTIVITY.  THE PIG TRAP WAS LAST USED DURING AN IN-LINE INSPECTION CONDUCTED ON JUNE 23, 2008.  A MORE THOROUGH EVALUATION WILL BE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE FAILURE MECHANISM THAT RESULTED IN THE RELEASE FROM THE FLANGED CONNECTION.    A HYDROCHEM (VACUUM TRUCK) EMPLOYEE, WHO ROUTINELY MONITORED AND MANAGED RESIDUAL OIL THAT ACCUMULATED IN REFINERY SUMPS, INCLUDING THE WEST YARD VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT, REPORTED THAT OIL ACCUMULATION APPEARED TO INTENSIFY AND WAS FOUND OUTSIDE THE VAULT BEGINNING ABOUT 3/15/2010.  THIS WAS BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY TYPICAL RESIDUAL GROUND SEEPAGE EXACERBATED BY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL AND SNOW THAW.  OPERATIONS TURNOVER REPORTS FROM 3/15/10 TO 3/25/10 HAVE ONLY ONE REPORT OF HEAVY OIL ON WATER (3/18/10).  THIS AGAIN WAS REMOVED BY HYDROCHEM VACUUM TRUCKS.   ON THE MORNING OF 3/16/2010 , TWO SUNOCO EMPLOYEES WERE IN THE WEST YARD FOR TRAINING PURPOSES AND DID NOT NOTICE A LEAK OR HEAVY OIL AT THAT TIME.  ON 3/24/2010 AT 11:00 HOURS, ANOTHER SUNOCO EMPLOYEE WAS IN THE WEST YARD AND DID NOT REPORT A RELEASE AT THAT TIME.    IN ADDITION, ON 3/24 AT 13:37 HOURS, A HYDROCHEM EMPLOYEE ENTERED THE WEST YARD TO VACUUM RESIDUAL OIL FROM THE VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT.  THE RELEASE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE STARTED IN THE 24 HOURS PRIOR TO DISCOVERY.    A TOTAL OF 1,700 BARRELS WAS RELEASED AND NEARLY ALL OF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN RECOVERED.    5/19/2010 UPDATE:  THE FM-1 PIG TRAP WAS ABOUT 39 1/2' IN LENGTH, MEASURED FROM THE FLANGE AT THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE TO THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS INITIALLY SUPPORTED AT THREE LOCATIONS.  THE TRAP WAS SUPPORTED AT THE CONTAINMENT WALL AROUND THE MANIFOLD, 9'-4' FROM THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY ITS FLANGED CONNECTION TO THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  DUE TO ITS LENGTH, IT WAS ALSO SUPPORTED, ADJACENT TO THE FAILED CENTER FLANGE.  THE CENTER FLANGE WAS 5'-0' FROM THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  THE CENTER SUPPORT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN LOCATED IN THE 5' SPOOL, WITHIN 12' FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.  THE SUPPORT CONSISTED OF A STRUCTURAL COLUMN, A BASE PLATE AT THE BOTTOM THAT RESTED ON THE FLOOR OF THE MANIFOLD CONTAINMENT, AND A TWO-PART CLAMP-STYLE FITTING AT THE TOP WHICH SECURED THE SUPPORT TO THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF THE CARRIER PIPE.  ONCE THE FM-1 TRAP WAS REMOVED, THE CENTER SUPPORT WAS FOUND IN THE CONTAINMENT, DETACHED AND SEPARATED FROM THE FM-1 TRAP PIPING.    IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE LACK OF SUPPORT AT THE CENTER FLANGE, ALLOWED PIPE MOVEMENT OVER TIME, INCLUDING MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THERMAL CYCLING, WHICH APPLIED A DIFFERENTIAL STRESS ON THE FLANGE BOLTS AND EVENTUALLY CAUSED THE FLANGE TO OPEN AT THE 8:00 O'CLOCK POSITION.  THE FM-1 TRAP INLET/OUTLET VALVE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A MECHANICAL DEFECT WHICH PREVENTED A TIGHT SHUT-OFF, WHICH ALLOWED PRODUCT FROM THE FM-1 PIPELINE TRANSFER TO PASS THROUGH THE VALVE, INTO THE PIG TRAP, CAUSING THE RELEASE FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.

THE RELIEF WAS ISOLATED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THE RELIEF WAS RELIEVING PREMATURELY 967 PSI. THE MAOP OF AD-23 IS 1000 PSI.     THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED ON 4/11/2022 (#1333256) OF THE RELEASE AND A 48 HR. FOLLOW UP WAS PROVIDED ON 4/12/2022 (#1333381).    THIS RELIEF VALVE HAS RELIEVED PREMATURELY PREVIOUSLY AND OPERATIONS ORDERED A REPLACEMENT VALVE IN APRIL OF 2022. LEAD TIME ON THE NEW VALVE WAS 18 WEEKS AT TIME OF ORDER AND HAS NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED. AFTER THIS RELEASE WAS SECURED, OPERATIONS NOTICIDED THE THE EXISTING VALVE WAS A DIAPHRAGM TYPE PILOT AND THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE THE ISSUE CAUSING IT TO RELIEVE PREMATURELY.  THE  PILOT HAS SINCE BEEN UPGRADED FROM A DIAPHRAGM TYPE TO A PISTON TYPE.  THE OPERATIONS GROUP LOCATED A PISTON PILOT THAT WAS NOT IN USE AND A SPARE PISTON PILOT OPERATOR HAS BEEN ORDERED TO KEEP ON THE SHELF (TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR RECEIPT IN AUGUST 2022). A FULL REBUILD KIT FOR THE RELIEF VALVE HAS BEEN ORDERED AS WELL SHOULD IT BE NEEDED. A PROJECT IS BEING DEVELOPED TO POSSIBLY RELOCATE THE VALVE.     LINE AD-23, ADM-14, AND LINE AD-WEST ARE ALL TIED TOGETHER AT THE WOODALL PLANT YARD. ALL LINES HAVE A 1000 PSI MAOP AND ARE ALL COMMON. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, AD-WEST HAS ROUTINELY OPERATED AT A HIGHER PRESSURE ANYWHERE FROM 925 TO 975 PSI. SINCE EACH RELEASE HAS BEEN PREMATURE, ENABLE THOUGHT REPLACING THE DIAPHRAGM PILOT (WHICH HAS A +/- 5% INITIATION) WITH A PISTON PILOT WOULD ALLOW AD-WEST TO OPERATE CLOSER TO MAOP.  THE DIAPHRAGM WORKED WELL WHEN THE LINE WAS OPERATING AT A LOWER PRESSURE BUT COULD CONTINUE TO PREMATURELY RELIEVE +/- 50 PSI EARLY IF NOT CHANGED TO THE PISTON STYLE.    05.12.2022 SUPPLEMENTAL   PART H NARRATIVE UPDATED.",16171.0,0.0,1000.0,96.7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE EVENT WAS DETERMINED TO EXCEED THE REPORTABLE THRESHOLD OF 3,000 MCF AND SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED TO THE NRC.     THE INTERNAL INCIDENT INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE STATION WARNING OCCURRED BECAUSE UNIT 1C EXPERIENCED A FAILURE OF THE 120VDC/24VDC POWER SUPPLY THAT POWERS THE SOLAR PANEL, PLC AND ASSOCIATED I/O'S. THE PLC CONTROLS THE POSITIONS (OPEN OR CLOSE) FOR THE COMPRESSOR UNIT MANIFOLD VALVES. BECAUSE THE PLC POWER FAILED, THE MANIFOLD VALVES REMAINED IN THE LAST POSITION AND THE UNIT BLOWDOWN VALVE OPENED. THE UNIT WAS RUNNING AT THE TIME OF THE PLC FAILURE. THEREFORE, THE UNIT SHUT DOWN THE MANIFOLD VALVES AND THE BLOWDOWN VALVE REMAINED OPEN ALLOWING GAS TO VENT.

THE OPERATIONS MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED AND HE CALLED NJDEP TO REPORT THE LEAK.  THE STATE ASSIGNED CASE NUMBER 10-05-19-1409-28 BY OPERATOR #4.  THE TANK WAS ISOLATED FROM THE SYSTEM BY LOCKING OUT ALL MANIFOLD VALVES AND REMOVING THE SHELL GATE VALVE AT THE TANK.  THE TANK WAS CLEANED AND GAS FREED IN ORDER TO BE INSPECTED.  LESS THAN 1 GALLON OF FUEL OIL WAS RECOVERED WITH DIAPERS.  THE AMOUNT SPILLED WAS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 5 GALLONS AND THEREFORE WAS NOT REPORTED TO PHMSA.      AN INTERNAL INSPECTION OF THE TANK REVEALED A CRACKED WELD ON THE ANGLE IRON AT THE RIM OF THE SUMP.  THE FAILED WELD WAS CUT OUT.

HE CONTACTED THE LEAD TECHNICIAN WHO SENT A TEAM TO ASSIST WITH EXCAVATING TO IDENTIFY THE LEAK SOURCE. AT 09:10 THEY DISCOVERED A LEAK FROM A PIPING ELBOW IN THE DRAIN SYSTEM FOR THE SUCTION SIDE OF THE UNIT.  THE UNIT WAS SHUT DOWN BY THE CONTROL CENTER AT 09:13 AND ISOLATED WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK. INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE AND BY 09:47 THE LOOP WAS ISOLATED, DRAINED, AND TEMPORARY REPAIRS BEGAN. THE ELBOW WAS REMOVED FROM THE DRAIN LINE AND BLIND FLANGES WERE INSTALLED. INITIAL CLEANUP AND EXCAVATION OF CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS COMPLETED BY 16:44. A PRELIMINARY VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE PIPING ELBOW FOUND A CRACK ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TOP FLANGE WHERE THE GIRTH WELD MAY NOT HAVE FULLY PENETRATED THE PIPE MATERIAL.

MR. WEISS INDICATED THAT EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE ON-SITE AND THAT THEY HAD BLOCKED OFF A SECTION OF THE ROAD. HE INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO RESIDENCES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. A REPRENTATIVE FROM MIDWEST NATURAL GAS CALLED TO CONFIRM THAT NATURAL GAS APPEARED TO BE BLOWING FROM VENT CASINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE LOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILES WEST OF THE TOWN OF MONDOVI, WISCONSIN. NORTHERN COMPANY EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE AND A GAS MANAGEMENT PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON THE THE PIPELINE TO APPROXIMATELY 520-550 PSIG FROM A TYPICAL 795 PSIG. PRESSURE WAS REDUCED BY PINCHING BLOCK VALVES AND LETTING CUSTOMER USAGE PULL THE PRESSURE DOWN ON THE LINE THEN CLOSELY MONITORING. EMERGENCY STOPPLE AND BYPASS PIPING WAS BROUGHT ON-SITE TESTED AND PLACED IN-SERVICE. MICHELS CONSTRUCTION, A CONTRACTOR, ASSISTED WITH EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES ON BOTH SIDE OF THE ROAD. UPON COMPLETION OF EXCAVATION A CRACK IN A PIPING GIRTH WELD WAS FOUND ON THE UNDER SIDE (SIX O'CLOCK POSITION) WHICH WENT ENTIRELY THROUGH THE PIPE, THE CRACK WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 1/2 INCHES LONG AND ONE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH WIDE. THE STEELE COUNTY ROAD DEPARTMENT WAS CONTACTED AND AGREED THAT NORTHERN COULD OPEN CUT THE ROAD FOR INSTALLING NEW TESTED PIPE. NORTHEN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESTORATION OF THE ROAD AND HARD SURFACING. APPROXIMATELY 60-FEET OF NEW TESTED, COATED PIPE WAS INSTALLED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO FIRE, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. THE PIPE WITH THE CRACKED GIRTH WELD WAS SENT TO AN OUTSIDE METALLURGICAL LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN RESULTS FROM THE METALLURICAL LABORATORY TESTS ARE RECEIVED AND A TOTAL COST OF THE REPAIRS IS COMPLILED. SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT (REFERENCE INITIAL REPORT 20130040 - 15978 DATED 05/13/2013 - THE FINAL COST FOR THIS EVENT HAS BEEN UPDATED. A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED BY BRYAN LABORATORY, INC. WITH FINDINGS OF THAT THE PIPE AT BOTH GIRTH WELDS EXAMINED WERE FOUND TO EXHIBIT MISALIGNMENT AND APPEAR TO BE DISTORTED. EXTRANEOUS WELDING WIRE WAS NOTED PROTRUDING FROM THE INTERNAL PORTIONS OF THE WELD. THE CRACK WAS FOUND TO BE 6-INCHES LONG AND IN THE LOWER QUADRANT OF THE WELD. ""NECKING DOWN"", TYPICAL OF DUCTILE OVERLOADING FRATURING, WAS NOTED IN THE PIPE ON THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE CRACKED AREA. IN THE LABORATORIES OPINION, THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY BENDING FORCES, AS SHOWN BY THE DISTORTION OF THE PIPE AT THE GIRTH WELD. BLACK DEPOSITS ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE CRACK AT THE OUTSIDE SURFACE SHOWED THAT A CRACK APPROXIMATELY 0.025 INCHES DEEP PRECEDED FINAL SEPARATION. FINAL SEPARATION INITIATED AT THE PREEXISTING CRACK AND FINAL SEPARATION WAS BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD.

THE INFORMATION REFLECTS THE CURRENT STATE OF BETA OFFSHORE'S KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING.  BETA OFFSHORE RESERVES ALL RIGHTS TO AMEND, WITHDRAW, CORRECT, ALTER, OR SUPPLEMENT ITS RESPONSES IN THIS FORM.    QUESTION A7: ON THE MORNING OF OCTOBER 2, 2021, AFTER BEING MADE AWARE OF AN OIL SHEEN BY THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS, BETA OFFSHORE INITIATED ITS OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLAN.  AS PART OF THAT OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLAN, BETA OFFSHORE CONTACTED WITT O'BRIEN, WHO IS TASKED WITH CONTACTING STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES.  THE TIME REFERENCED IN A7 IS BASED ON BETA OFFSHORE'S CURRENT UNDERSTANDING AS TO WITT O'BRIEN'S ACTIONS ON OCTOBER 2, 2021.  QUESTION A11:  ON NOVEMBER 30, 2021 UNIFIED COMMAND RELEASED A WASTE STREAM MANAGEMENT REPORT THAT INDICATED THAT 132 BARRELS (5,544 GALLONS) OF CRUDE OIL HAS BEEN RECOVERED.  IN ADDITION TO THE 5,544 GALLONS OF CRUDE OIL COLLECTED, 68,620 POUNDS OF OILY SAND AND 74,040 POUNDS OF OILY WATER HAVE BEEN COLLECTED.  THE FORM DOES NOT PERMIT FOR POUNDS OF RECOVERED OIL PRODUCTS, SO THE NUMBER IN QUESTION A11 REPRESENTS THE 132 BARRELS RECOVERED.   QUESTION A18.B: THE REPORTED TIME OPERATOR ASSETS WERE ON SITE CORRESPONDS TO WHEN SHIP SERVICES CONTACTED THE PLATFORM AND IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS A SPILL.   QUESTION B14: THE INFORMATION PROVIDED REFLECTS THE PLATFORM LOCATION, WHICH WAS ~4.5 MILES AWAY FROM THE LEAK LOCATION.  QUESTION C6:  THE APPROXIMATE WIDTH AND LENGTH OF THE CRACK ARE BASED UPON EVALUATION OF THE PIPELINE ON THE SEAFLOOR AND REPRESENTS THE BEST ESTIMATES AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  FROM AN EXTERNAL EVALUATION BETA BELIEVES THAT THE LARGEST WIDTH OF THE CRACK IS .008 INCHES.  QUESTION C6 DOES NOT PERMIT ENTRY OF A CRACK OF .008 INCHES, SO THE ANSWER PROVIDED OF '0.1' IS THE SMALLEST ALLOWABLE INCREMENT TO REPRESENT A CRACK OF THIS WIDTH.    QUESTION D3: APPROXIMATELY 588 BARRELS OF OIL WERE UNINTENTIONALLY RELEASED INTO THE SAN PEDRO BAY.  AT THIS TIME, BETA OFFSHORE DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE IS NEED FOR A LONG-TERM IMPACT ASSESSMENT, ALTHOUGH BETA IS AWARE THAT ONGOING NRDA WORK IS ONGOING.  QUESTION D8: APPROXIMATELY 588 BARRELS OF OIL WERE UNINTENTIONALLY RELEASED INTO THE SAN PEDRO BAY.  CURRENTLY CLAIMS ARE BEING MADE AND PROCESSED.  BETA OFFSHORE IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE CLAIMS, BUT AT THIS TIME IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF THE DAMAGES IN CATEGORIES 8A, 8C, 8E AND 8F.  FOR PURPOSES OF 8B, THE CALCULATION IS THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF CRUDE OIL AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 ($76.01) TIMES THE 588 BARRELS THAT WERE LEAKED.  THE COSTS REFERENCED IN QUESTION 8D ARE THOSE COSTS THAT WERE PAID OR AUTHORIZED TO BE PAID RELATED TO REMEDIATION EFFORTS AS OF NOVEMBER 11, 2021, CERTAIN PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE.    QUESTION E1:  IN ADDITION TO INVESTIGATIONS BEING RUN BY STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, BETA OFFSHORE IS CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE TIME AND SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE OIL SPILL.  BETA OFFSHORE WILL SUPPLEMENT ITS RESPONSE WITH THE PRESSURE WHEN IT DETERMINES THE PRECISE TIME THAT THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.   QUESTION E5.C: THE LENGTH OF THE PIPELINE SEGMENT BETWEEN THE VALVES THAT ARE CURRENTLY CLOSED IS APPROXIMATELY 91,642 FEET (17.34 MILES).  THAT INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 81,122 FEET (15.36 MILES) FROM PLATFORM ELLY'S ML1 VALVE TO ML4 VALVE IN QUEEN MARY VAULT AND APPROXIMATELY 10,520 FEET (1.99 MILES) FROM ML4 VALVE TO 520 & 530 VALVES AT BETA STATION.  QUESTION E8:  MEMBERS OF SHIP SERVICES CONDUCTED A DAYLIGHT LINE RIDE ON OCTOBER 2 AND REPORTED THE OIL SHEEN TO BETA PERSONNEL AT APPROXIMATELY 8:00 AM.    QUESTION G8:  IN ADDITION TO INVESTIGATIONS BEING RUN BY STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, BETA OFFSHORE IS CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE TIME AND SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE OIL SPILL.

MANHATTAN BLVD, TOLEDO, OH.  THE CONTROL CENTER CONTACTED THE LOCAL OPERATIONS MANAGER AT 13:27 AND A PIPELINER WAS DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO INVESTIGATE. THE PIPELINE WAS ALREADY DOWN ON NORMAL SCHEDULE AT THE TIME.  AFTER LOCAL PERSONNEL ARRIVED THE AREA WAS ASSESSED WITH LEL MONITORS AND PROBING, AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A BUTANE LEAK WAS PRESENT. APPROXIMATELY 0.3 BARREL OF BUTANE WAS CALCULATED TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED BASED ON SURFACE OBSERVATION.  ON 7/15/21 AFTER EXCAVATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO A PINHOLE IN A GIRTH WELD AND THAT THE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR THE RELEASE WOULD EXCEED $50,000 AND THAT NOTIFICATION TO NRC WOULD BE REQUIRED.  THIS NOTIFICATION WAS MADE AT AT 11:11 AM EST ON 7/15/21 (NRC# 1310774). A 48-HR UPDATE TO THE NRC WAS PLACED ON 7/16/21 AT 5:26 PM EST (NRC # 1310967).  A MECHANICAL BOLT ON CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND THE LINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE. DURING A SCHEDULED DOWN TIME ON 7/22/21, THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE WAS CUT OUT AND SENT TO A METALLURGICAL LAB FOR ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAILURE CAUSE. A SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE WILL BE FILED ONCE THE FAILURE ANALYSIS REPORT IS RECEIVED.     UPDATE: THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY ELONGATED POROSITY IN THE OXYACETYLENE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION GIRTH WELD.

TIE-IN WORK CONSISTED OF TWO TIE-IN WELDS; ONE ON THE NORTH END AND ONE ON THE SOUTH END, AND FIVE BOLT UPS. SOME OF THE BOLT UPS WERE ON ANSI #600 FLANGES AND SOME WERE ON ANSI #900 FLANGES.     THE PIPE INSTALLATION WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY A COMBINATION OF THE SINCLAIR CONSTRUCTION GROUP AND A CONTRACTOR. THE SINCLAIR PERSONNEL ACTED AS THE QUALIFIED OQ INDIVIDUALS OBSERVING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED OQ INDIVIDUALS (CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL) IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 6.6 IN SINCLAIR'S OQ WRITTEN PLAN.     DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS THE MOV TO THE THIRD-PARTY SHIPPER IS OPEN AND LINE PRESSURE RANGES BETWEEN 70 PSI AND 170 PSI DEPENDING ON INCOMING FLOW RATES INTO THE SYSTEM.     ON 10/6/21 SINCLAIR OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ALIGNED THE CR20 PIG TRAPS FOR PERIODIC MAINTENANCE PIGGING. PART OF THIS PROCESS IS TO CLOSE A VALVE (CR20 MOV) TO THE THIRD-PARTY SHIPPER ENABLING ALL FLOW TO GO NORTH TO THE NORTH TRAP. DURING MAINTENANCE PIGGING NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE RANGES BETWEEN 600 PSI AND 800 PSI.    AT 07:30 THE CR20 MOV WAS CLOSED AND A PIG WAS LAUNCHED WITHOUT INCIDENT. SOME TIME LATER A LEAK DEVELOPED AT A FLANGE ON THE NORTH LINE.  UPON DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK THE CR20 MOV WAS OPENED, REDUCING THE PRESSURE AND LEAK FLOW RATE.  FURTHER ISOLATION OF THE LEAKING FLANGE ENSUED. REMAINING LINE PRESSURE AND LINE FILL AT THE FLANGE WAS THEN DRAINED INTO THE SUMP.    UPON DISASSEMBLY OF THE ANSI #900 FLANGE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE GASKET USED WAS A MISTAKENLY INSTALLED ANSI #600 GASKET. THIS GASKET WAS RESTING ON THE BOTTOM BOLTS. SOME OF THE WINDINGS WERE UNRAVELING AND IT WAS OBSERVED THE SEALING SURFACE OF THE GASKET AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION WAS MISSHAPEN.     THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF A PROPERLY SIZED GASKET IS DESIGNED SUCH THAT IT SELF-CENTERS ON THE FLANGE WHEN RESTING ON THE BOLTS.  THEREFORE THE INSIDE DIAMETER OF THE #600 GASKET DID NOT LINE UP WITH THE INSIDE DIAMETER OF THE FLANGE BORE.

IT APPEARED THAT THE RELEASE HAD OCCURRED ON A 3-INCH BALON SERIES F CARBON STEEL CLASS 150 BALL VALVE ON SURGE RELIEF BYPASS LINE AT THE 8030 SKID AT THE GRASSLANDS TERMINAL FACILITY. OPERATIONS CONTROL CENTER WAS CALLED TO SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATE THE 8030 SKID AT 07:15. COMMAND CENTER WAS ESTABLISHED ON THE WEST SIDE OF TERMINAL DUE TO WIND OUT OF THE WEST, THEN AREA WAS TAPED OFF.

ONCE CONFIRMED DISCOVERY WAS REACHED AT 09:30, DETAILS WERE COORDINATED WITH COMPLIANCE AND A NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NRC AT 10:23 IN REPORT #1332138. THE OSRO CONTRACTOR ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 10:30 TO VAC LIQUID. ALL EMERGENCY ONE CALLS WERE CLEARED.     THE VALVE LEAKED FROM AN EXTRUSION OF THE O-RING BETWEEN THE FLANGE FACES OF THE VALVE BODY AND THE ADAPTER. A THIRD PARTY, STRESS ENGINEERING, INVESTIGATED THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE (SEPARATION OF BODY FLANGE FACES) AND CONCLUDED THAT THE BOLTED BODY CONNECTION NUTS MANUFACTURED BY BALON EXHIBITED LOWER BREAKOUT TORQUES ON THE VALVE BODY DUE TO INSUFFICIENT MAKEUP TORQUE AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE. PIPING VIBRATION, STUD YIELDING, AND O-RING DEGRADATION WERE ALSO ANALYZED, BUT EVIDENCE DID NOT ATTRIBUTE THESE MECHANISMS TO THE FAILURE.

AT 20:25 NV ENERGY (NVE) WAS CONTACTED BY THE CITY OF RENO PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCH NOTIFYING OF A ""WORKING FIRE"" AT 624 EUREKA AVENUE IN RENO, NEVADA.  NVE GAS DISPATCH SENDS GAS SERVICEMEN TO INVESTIGATE.  AT 20:51 THE CITY OF RENO PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCH CONTACTED NVE AGAIN TO REPORT THAT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION AT THIS LOCATION, POSSIBLY FROM THE FURNACE.      AT 21:02 THE FIRST NVE PERSONNEL ARRIVE AT THE SITE AND FOUND THE HOME AT 624 EUREKA AVE DAMAGED BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GAS EXPLOSION WITH INDICATIONS OF UNDERGROUND GAS READINGS.  RENO FIRE DEPARTMENT AND NVE PERSONNEL EVACUATE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND MONITOR GAS CONCENTRATIONS WHILE OTHER NVE PERSONNEL EXPOSE THE SERVICE TEE AND SECURE THE GAS LEAK.      THE LEAK OCCURRED AT THE THREADED JOINT BETWEEN A 3/4"" BLACK IRON PIPE NIPPLE AND A 3/4"" BLACK IRON 90 DEGREE ELBOW AT THE SERVICE TEE CONNECTION TO 614 EUREKA AVENUE.  BASED UPON THE RENO FIRE DEPARTMENT INCIDENT REPORT, NATURAL GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE TEE APPEARS TO HAVE TRAVELED THROUGH A SERVICE TRENCH INTO THE BASEMENT OF 624 EUREKA.  THE LEAKING GAS WAS IGNITED IN THE BASEMENT BY THE FURNACE, EXPLODED, AND DAMAGED THE HOME.  TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE IN THE RESIDENCE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION BUT NO INJURIES WERE SUSTAINED.  THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE CAUSE IS DETERMINED.     AT 22:36 THE NVE DUTY SUPERVISOR ON SCENE DETERMINED THAT THE PROPERTY DAMAGE COSTS WOULD EXCEED $50,000.  THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS MADE AT 22:49 AND WAS GIVEN NRC INCIDENT REPORT # 1207485.  NVE PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE NRC ON MARCH 23, 2018 AT 15:44 AND WAS GIVEN NRC INCIDENT REPORT # 1207546.    SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE:  FURTHER ANALYSIS HAS DETERMINED THAT THE PIPE-TO-ELBOW JOINT FAILED DUE TO OVERLOAD FROM AN EXTERNAL BENDING LOAD AND NOT DUE TO A MATERIAL OR MANUFACTURING DEFECT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PIPES OR FITTINGS.  THE EXTERNAL BENDING LOAD AT THE FAILED PIPE-TO-ELBOW JOINT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF LOADING IMPARTED TO THIS JOINT DURING COMPACTION AROUND THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION.  NV ENERGY'S CONTRACTOR WAS PERFORMING BACKFILL AND COMPACTION ACTIVITIES ON THIS TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT OCCURRING.       FINAL UPDATE:  ANALYSIS HAS CONCLUDED AND THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY A LEAK FROM A CRACK IN THE BLACK IRON PIPE USED FOR THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION FOR THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY 614 EUREKA AVENUE. THE GAS MIGRATED INTO THE BASEMENT OF THE INCIDENT HOUSE WHERE IT FOUND AN IGNITION SOURCE, MOST LIKELY THE HOUSE FURNACE. THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE CRACK IN THE PIPE WAS MECHANICAL OVERLOADING OF THE HORIZONTAL SECTION OF THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION.  THE MECHANICAL OVERLOADING WAS LIKELY CAUSED DURING COMPACTION OF SAND AROUND THE TEMPORARY SERVICE CONNECTION, DUE TO INSUFFICIENT COVER (SAND ABOVE THE PIPE) DURING COMPACTION.",80.0,0.0,40.0,92.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.87,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

IN THE DAYS PRECEDING THE SPILL, THE TWO INCOMING MARATHON LINES WERE DRAINED TO THE MANIFOLD SUMP IN PREPARATION TO REMOVE THE LINES FROM SERVICE. MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO COMPLETELY DRAIN THE PRODUCT WITHOUT COMPLETE SUCCESS; BECAUSE, IT WAS LATER DETERMINED, PRODUCT WAS LEAKING BY ONE OR MORE OF THE FUEL MANIFOLD VALVES. THE OWS WAS IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED ALONG WITH ALL OTHER OPERATIONS IN THE MANIFOLD. AT 10:00 THE OM NOTIFIED THE EAST FELICIANA PARISH DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND THE LA STATE POLICE WAS NOTIFIED VIA SPOC HOTLINE AT 10:06 (INCIDENT NUMBER 15-04428).  AT 11:20 A REPORT WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER BASED ON THE POTENTIAL TO EXCEED $50,000 RESPONSE/ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE (REPORT #1131335). DIRT DAMS WERE IMMEDIATELY CONSTRUCTED IN THE DITCH AND BOOM WAS DEPLOYED ON THE POND. THE OWS WAS CLEANED OUT AND HAD WATER ADDED AND REMAINED ISOLATED. A CONTRACT CREW WAS DEPLOYED TO PROVIDE TWO LAYERS OF CONTAINMENT AND ABSORBENT BOOM IN THE POND. INITIAL CLEANUP EFFORTS WERE COMPLETED AT 20:15. ON 10/24 DURING A PERIOD OF HEAVY RAIN, PRODUCT WAS IDENTIFIED ON THE RETENTION POND AGAIN AND A VACUUM TRUCK AND CREW WAS CALLED IN TO RECOVER THIS PRODUCT. THE PRODUCT HAD BEEN PUSHED INTO A CULVERT ON 10/21 BY THE PREVAILING WIND AND WAS FLUSHED OUT OF THE CULVERT WHEN RAIN WATER WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE CULVERT.  A CONTRACT CREW WAS ALSO DISPATCHED TO ADD ADDITIONAL CONTAINMENT AND ABSORBENT BOOM TO THE POND IN ANTICIPATION OF MORE RAIN THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  THE RECOVERY EFFORTS ON THIS DAY STARTED AT 16:30 AND CONTINUED UNTIL 2:30 ON 10/25. SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION DETERMINED PRODUCT WAS FLOWING INTO THE OWS WHEN THE MARATHON LINES WERE BEING DRAINED TO THE MANIFOLD SUMP. THE DRAIN LINES ARE CONNECTED TO THE OWS PRODUCT DISCHARGE PIPING (TO THE SUMP), WHICH IS DESIGNED TO GRAVITY DRAIN TO THE SUMP. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE OWS INTERFACE DETECTOR ALARM FAILED TO OPERATE PROPERLY (NO ALARM WAS GIVEN). INCIDENT ANALYSIS DETERMINED THREE IMMEDIATE CAUSES:  1) FUEL MANIFOLD VALVES NOT HOLDING (LEAKING BY), 2) MANIFOLD DID NOT DRAIN AS DESIGNED (FLOWED TO OWS AND SUMP), 3) OWS INTERFACE ALARM DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. ANALYSIS ALSO DETERMINED FOUR BASIC CAUSES:  1) INADEQUATE/IMPROPER ENGINEERING (IMPROPER DRAIN), 2) LACK OF PROCEDURES (NO PM OR MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES FOR OWS ALARM DEVICE), 3) LACK OF PROCEDURES (NO DRAIN-UP PROCEDURES FOR MARATHON INCOMING MANIFOLD), 4) LACK OF MOC.

IN COOPERATION WITH THE PUCO, THE FAILED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE (ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL SECTIONS IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE SECTION CONTAINING ADDITIONAL WELDS FOR TESTING) WERE EXTRACTED AND RETAINED BY DNV FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE PROTOCOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY DEO AND THE PUCO. DNV ISSUED ITS FINAL METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS REPORT ON 5-18-20, AND DEO HAS CONCLUDED ITS REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT.  ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT INDICATES THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF AXIAL BENDING STRESSES ON THE PIPE STRING, LIKELY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A CAVERN OR VOID IN THE ROCK FORMATION THROUGH WHICH THE AUGER PASSED, WHICH CAUSED THE AUGER TO VEER OFF COURSE. THE BENDING STRESS CAUSED THE FIELD GIRTH WELD LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF THE CAVERN TO FAIL, PRIMARILY IN DUCTILE OVERLOAD.

KINDER MORGAN DECIDED TO FILE AN NRC REPORT ON 5/26/2016, AFTER THE NORTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ASKED KINDER MORGAN AND ITS REMEDIATION CONTRACTOR TO INSTALL SOME MONITORING WELLS WHICH KINDER MORGAN FORECASTED THE ADDITIONAL COSTS WOULD EVENTUALLY CAUSE OUR EVENT EXPENDITURES TO EXCEED THE $50,000 NRC REPORTING CRITERIA.     UPDATE: 10/25/2016.  PHMSA-CE REGION REQUESTED TO REVISE PART C, ITEM 6 OF THIS REPORT FROM ""LEAK/OTHER/INADEQUATE INSTALLATION"" TO ""LEAK/CONNECTION FAILURE"".  A FINAL REPORT IS STILL PENDING FINAL CLEAN UP COSTS.      UPDATE: 2/16/2017.    THE REMEDIATION OF THE RELEASE AND ASSOCIATED TESTING HAS REACHED $260,000.  FINAL CLEANUP COSTS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE NEXT SET OF SOIL SAMPLING ANALYSIS.    UPDATE: 8/10/2017.  THE REMEDIATION OF THE RELEASE AND ASSOCIATED TESTING HAS REACHED $280,000. THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FINAL CLEAN UP COSTS.    UPDATE: 10/11/2017.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, KM HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CONTRACT EMPLOYEE WHO INCORRECTLY TIGHTENED THE SCREWED UNION FITTING WAS NOT QUALIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH KM'S OPERATOR QUALIFICATION PROGRAM TO PERFORM THIS TASK.  ALTHOUGH THERE WERE OTHER PERSONNEL ON SITE THAT DID HAVE THE CORRECT OPERATOR QUALIFIED TASK TO PERFORM THE TASK IN QUESTION THEY WERE NOT INSTRUCTED TO ""DIRECT AND OBSERVE"" THIS SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE AS THE EMPLOYEE IN QUESTION WAS ORIGINALLY BELIEVED TO HAVE THE CORRECT KM OPERATOR QUALIFICATIONS.

THE LINE WAS NOT OPERATING AT THE TIME THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED; HOWEVER, UPON DISCOVERING THE LEAK, THE AREA SUPERVISOR INSTRUCTED ONE OF THE OTHER EMPLOYEES ON SITE TO CALL THE CONTROL CENTER AND ASK THEM TO LOCKOUT THE PIPELINE SO IT COULDN'T BE RESTARTED.  THE AREA SUPERVISOR THEN CALLED OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND INFORMED THEM OF THE LEAK AND DISCUSSED MOBILIZING RESOURCES TO THE SITE TO EXPOSE THE LINE AND DETERMINE THE LOCATION AND CAUSE OF THE LEAK.  THE AREA SUPERVISOR THEN ISOLATED THE SEGMENT BY CLOSING THE NEAREST UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM VALVES.    WHEN THE COMPANY PIPELINE MAINTENANCE CREW ARRIVED ON SITE THEY BEGAN EXCAVATING AND EXPOSED THE PIPELINE IN THE AREA WHERE THE LEAK WAS SUSPECTED.  AFTER THE LINE WAS EXPOSED, THEY DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS THE RESULT OF A CRACKED GIRTH WELD AND APPLIED A TEMPORARY LEAK CLAMP UNTIL THE LINE COULD BE FULLY EXPOSED AND THE SEGMENT DRAINED UP AND CUT OUT.  THE LINE WAS THEN SUBSEQUENTLY DRAINED, FULLY EXPOSED, AND THE SEGMENT THAT LEAKED REMOVED.

ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 1, 2022 THE MIDKIFF LOCATION EXPERIENCED THE FIRST FREEZE OF THE YEAR, REACHING TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 16-19 DEGREES F. THESE BELOW FREEZING TEMPERATURES RESULTED IN THE WATER FREEZING, AND THE EXPANSION OF THAT VOLUME RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN PRESSURE THAT DISENGAGED THE VALVE SEAT FROM THE BALL ON THE DOWNSTREAM END, RESULTING IN THE UPSTREAM SEAT NOT FULLY SEALING AGAINST THE BALL. THIS ALLOWED OIL TO THEN PASS THROUGH THE VALVE WHILE IN THE LOCKED AND CLOSED POSITION. TO HELP PREVENT AND MITIGATE THE RISK OF REPETITION, THE PROCEDURES IN THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE MANUAL AND HYDROSTATIC TESTING GUIDELINES WERE UPDATED TO INCLUDE INSPECTION OF REMOVAL OF WATER FOR ALL FACILITY PIPING AND COMPONENTS.

OPERATOR WENT TO STATION 24, VERIFIED THE EBD VALVE THAT HAD OPENED, AND OPERATED THE GAS-POWERED ACTUATOR TO CLOSE THE VALVE. THE VALVE WAS CLOSED COMPLETELY AND RELEASE STOPPED.  THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO A EIM VALVE ACTUATOR THAT MOVED AN EBD VALVE OPEN WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY SIGNAL TO DO SO.

HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHEN THE VALVE WAS LEFT OPEN OR WHICH OPERATOR FAILED TO CLOSE THE VALVE.   TO PREVENT REOCCURRENCE OF THIS INCIDENT, THE TUBING (FROM THE AIR ELIMINATOR VALVE) WAS DISCONNECTED, AND VALVE AT THE AIR ELIMINATOR WAS PLUGGED.  THIS ELIMINATED THE TUBING DEADLEG.  IF THE TUBING IS NEEDED (TO VENT THE PROVER DURING MAINTENANCE), IT WILL BE RECONNECTED, USED, AND THEN DISCONNECTED WHEN NOT IN USE.      IN ADDITION, THE FACILITY WAS INSPECTED TO DETERMINE IF SIMILAR TUBING CONNECTIONS EXISTED.  WHERE FOUND, THESE WERE DISCONNECTED AND PLUGGED TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT ELSEWHERE IN THE FACILITY.",11458.046793760832,0.0,710.0,45.07042253521127,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.315,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA) OPERATES AND MAINTAINS DELHI CS WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS A TRANSMISSION CS, IS LOCATED IN RICHLAND PARISH, LOUISIANA AND NEAR THE CITY OF DELHI. AFTER RECEIVING THE NOTIFICATION FROM COLUMBIA MONITORING CENTER, CS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THIS POSSIBLE ALARM AT DELHI CS AND ADDRESSED THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS (MATERIAL) THAT WAS VENTING INTO ATMOSPHERE FROM BLOW DOWN DISCHARGE STACK 8SH-1BD. THE CS PERSONNEL INSPECTED AND SECURED THE AREA TO ENSURE THAT IT WAS SAFE TO OPERATE DISCHARGE VALVES BEFORE MANUALLY CLOSING THEM. INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT IDENTIFIED THE PROBABLE CAUSE THAT LED TO THIS UNINTENDED RELEASE WAS DUE TO THE OPEN COMMAND SOLENOID VALVE COIL (8SH-1BD) FAILING AS DETERMINED BY AN UNUSUALLY HIGH RESISTANCE MEASURED AT THE COIL.    THIS SOLENOID VALVE IS A FAIL OPEN SOLENOID THAT REQUIRES VOLTAGE TO THE COIL TO KEEP THE VALVE IN THE CLOSED POSITION. ONCE THE COIL FAILED THE VALVE (8SH-1BD) BEGAN TO OPEN UNTIL THE CLOSED LIMITS WERE BROKEN. ONCE THE LIMITS WERE BROKEN THE CLOSE SOLENOID WHICH IS A FAIL CLOSED SOLENOID ENERGIZED AND ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE VALVE UNTIL THE CLOSE LIMIT SWITCHES WERE MADE. THE SOLENOID VALVE WAS REBUILT BY REPLACING ARMATURE, SPRING, ORING, AND COIL. THE LIMIT SWITCH CAMS WERE ADJUSTED AND TIGHTENED TO ENSURE THIS ISSUE DOESN'T RE-OCCUR. ALL ALARMS WERE CLEARED AT THE PLC CONTROL PANEL, REQUIRED FUNCTIONAL TESTS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NO NEW ERRORS GENERATED (TO ENSURE NORMAL OPERATION OF THE UNIT), THEN THE UNIT WAS RETURNED BACK TO SERVICE. ROUTINE SAFETY CHECKS WERE CONDUCTED WHERE THE UNIT WAS MONITORED FOR A WHILE, VERIFIED THAT ALL SYSTEMS ARE RUNNING IN NORMAL MODE WITH NO NEW ERRORS WERE GENERATED THEREAFTER.

WHEN THE ALARM WAS DETECTED, A TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE COMPRESSOR STATION TO INVESTIGATE. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE AT 12:40 CT, THE TECHNICIAN DISCOVERED NATURAL GAS BEING RELEASED THROUGH THE STATION'S BLOWDOWN STACKS.  IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS TAKEN BY VERIFYING NO EMERGENCY EXISTED AND CLOSING THE VALVES, WHICH ENDED THE RELEASE AT 12:45 CT.  UNINTENTIONAL GAS LOSS WAS CALCULATED TO 5.7 MILLION CUBIC FEET (MMCF). NO PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INJURIES WERE DOCUMENTED AND NO EVACUATIONS WERE REQUIRED.    THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A FLAME DETECTION EQUIPMENT (FIRE EYE) THAT INITIATED THE ACTIVATION OF THE ESD SYSTEM.  WHEN THE SYSTEM ACTIVATED, STATION ISOLATION VALVE 501-14-16 FAILED TO FULLY CLOSE RESULTING IN THE RELEASE GAS.    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, DELHI COMPRESSOR STATION WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE DURING THE INVESTIGATION.  VALVE 501-14-16 WAS LOCKED OUT OF SERVICE AND BY-PASSED TO ANOTHER ESD VALVE CAPABLE OF ISOLATING THE STATION.  THE FLAME DETECTION EQUIPMENT WAS REMOVED FROM THE BUILDING AND REPLACED.  DELHI COMPRESSOR STATION WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON JUNE 10, 2019.  THE COMPRESSOR ENGINE BUILDING WHERE THE SHUTDOWN WAS INITIATED REMAINED OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL JUNE 14 AT 15:45 CT.  DURING THE SHUTDOWN PERIOD, NO ADDITIONAL FLAME DETECTION ACTIVATIONS WERE DETECTED.      THE FLAME DETECTOR UNIT WAS SENT TO THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER FOR EVALUATION.  THE MANUFACTURER REPORTED THAT THE UNIT MET ALL MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS AND OPERATED AS INTENDED.  THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDED THAT THE UNIT'S SENSITIVITY BE REDUCED FROM ""HIGH"" TO ""MEDIUM"".  THIS RECOMMENDED CHANGE IS DUE TO THE OPERATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION IN THE RECIPROCATING ENGINE COMPRESSOR BUILDING.  THE CHANGE IN SENSITIVITY DOES NOT AFFECT THE SAFETY OF THE PIPELINE FACILITY AND THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN TESTED ACCORDING TO PROCEDURES.  THIS ACTION WAS COMPLETED ON JULY 26, 2019.    ON 19 NOVEMBER 2019 INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIAL ACTION WAS TAKEN TO REPAIR VALVE 501-14-16, WHICH FAILED TO OPERATE FULLY CLOSED DURING A STATION ESD. THE 3-WAY PILOT VALVE, WHICH SENDS POWER GAS TO OPERATE THE VALVE WHEN PILOT PRESSURE DROPS OUT, WAS REPLACED. AN EXTRA POWER GAS BOTTLE WAS ALSO INSTALLED IN LINE WITH THE POWER GAS SUPPLY LINE TO ENSURE WE HAVE AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF POWER GAS TO FULLY STROKE THE VALVE.    AN FULL EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED ON 11/19/2019 TO TEST REPAIRS ON VALVE 501-14-16. DURING THIS TEST, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT PRESSURE TO THE POWER GAS SUPPLY ON THE ACTUATOR DROPPED OUT CAUSING THE VALVE TO NOT OPERATE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE PILOT GAS SUPPLY WAS INSTALLED INTO THE POWER GAS PORT AND THE POWER GAS SUPPLY WAS INSTALLED INTO THE PILOT GAS PORT ON THE OPERATOR. THE SWITCHING OF THESE SUPPLIES CAUSED AN INCOMPLETE OPERATION OF THE VALVE DUE TO RELIEVING PRESSURE OF THE PILOT GAS DURING AN ESD INITIATION.    THESE LINES WERE SWITCHED TO THE CORRECT PORTS ON THE ACTUATOR AND PROPER OPERATION FOR VALVE CLOSURE WAS DOCUMENTED.  VALVE 501-14-16 WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON 22 NOVEMBER 2019.",23171.0,0.0,858.0,97.31934731934732,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DOMINION REPRESENTATIVES REPORTED TO THE AREA AND VERIFIED A LEAK. GAS CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED TO BEGIN PRESSURE REDUCTIONS IN THE LINE BEGINNING AT APPROXIMATELY 14:00, AND A BLOW DOWN PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED AROUND 18:00 ON THE SAME DAY. THE SITE WAS EXCAVATED ON MARCH 17, 2016 AND THE LEAK WAS VALIDATED. THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED SECTION OF PIPE ON MARCH 19, 2016 AND THE LINE RESTORED TO SERVICE.    THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS ANALYZED INTERNALLY DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL SIMILARITIES FROM A RECENTLY REPORTED FAILURE, WHICH WAS SENT TO A 3RD PARTY LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE INTERNAL ANALYSIS, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THIS FAILURE ARE IDENTICAL. THE PREVIOUS FAILURE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD OF THE PIPE WALL AT THE WELD TOE. THE PRIMARY FACTOR TO THE FAILURE WAS SETTLEMENT OF THE BRANCH CONNECTION DUE TO IMPROPER SUPPORT. THE SETTLEMENT CAUSED BENDING STRESSES IN THE CARRIER PIPE AT THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT FILLET WELD WHICH RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF A CRACK. THE GEOMETRY OF THE FILLET WELD THAT ATTACHED THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT PAD TO THE CARRIER PIPE WAS ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE. THE SADDLE THICKNESS WAS 2.5 TIMES THE THICKNESS OF THE CARRIER PIPE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A STRESS CONCENTRATION IN THE THINNER PIPE AT THE FILLET WELD TOE. UNDERCUT AT THE TOE OF THE FILLET WELD FURTHER CONCENTRATED THE STRESS AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FORMATION OF A CRACK.",21624.0,0.0,675.0,88.14814814814815,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.485,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

LINE 41 WAS SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATED AS A PRECAUTION.  THE ECC NOTIFIED THE ON-CALL OPERATIONS TECHNICIAN TO INVESTIGATE THE SUMP AT HIAWATHA STATION.  THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED ONSITE AT 1:05 AM CST AND DISCOVERED APPROXIMATELY 10 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL ON THE GROUND.  INITIAL OBSERVATIONS CONFIRMED THAT THE RELEASE POINT WAS AN OVERFLOW OF THE SUMP.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL FROM PLATTE, ALONG WITH PERSONNEL FROM KEY WERE DISPATCHED IMMEDIATELY.  SPILL CONTRACTORS WERE REQUESTED TO ASSIST WITH THE CLEAN-UP.  THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED AT 3:15 AM CST ON NOVEMBER 30, 2018 (NRC#1231673) WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT COSTS COULD EXCEED THE $50,000 THRESHOLD DUE TO THE VOLUME OUT AND COST OF CLEAN-UP. THE 48 HOUR UPDATE TO THE NRC WAS MADE AT 6:32 PM CST ON DECEMBER 1, 2018 (NRC#1231818).    UPON INVESTIGATION, THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A DRAIN VALVE ON THE SUCTION SIDE OF A PUMP UNIT THAT WAS PARTIALLY OPEN WHICH LED TO THE SUMP OVERFLOW.  THE ECC DID NOT DETECT AN ISSUE UNTIL THE SUMP HIGH-HIGH ALARM WAS SIGNALED.  THE EVIDENCE IS INCONCLUSIVE ON EXACTLY WHEN AND HOW THE VALVE WAS PARTIALLY OPENED.  HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THAT THE VALVE BECAME PARTIALLY OPENED SOMETIME DURING THE UNRELATED SHUTDOWN AND WENT UNNOTICED UNTIL THE ECC BEGAN TO RESTART LINE 41.    APPROXIMATELY 467 TONS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS BEEN PROPERLY DISPOSED OF AT AN APPROVED LANDFILL. NO PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO THE SYSTEM AND WAS RECOVERED AS PART OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL.    THE HIGH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RELEASE WERE DUE TO POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS (RAIN AND SNOW) WHICH CREATED ADDITIONAL MATERIALS THAT HAD TO BE PUT INTO ROLL OFF CONTAINERS ALONG WITH HYDROVAC EXCAVATION WITHIN THE STATION THAT ALSO ADDED ADDITIONAL MATERIALS FOR ROLL OFFS.  THIS ALSO INCLUDED SAMPLING OF ALL THE CONTAINERS PRIOR TO HAULING THE MATERIAL OFF SITE.  IN ADDITION, MORE SOIL WAS EXCAVATED THAN NORMAL.

WHEN WELDER # 1 CAME UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE TO THE 9 O'CLOCK POSITION HE ACQUIRED A NEW ROD; AS SOON AS HE ARCED UP ON THE CARRIER PIPE IT STARTED HISSING AND BLEW OUT RESULTING IN A PRODUCT RELEASE.  WELDER # 1 QUICKLY TOLD WELDER # 2 THEY HAD A PROBLEM AND TO STOP WELDING.  THE WELDING INSPECTOR REMOVED ALL PERSONNEL FROM THE EXCAVATION SITE AND CALLED PIPELINE CONTROL TO SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE.  THE LEAK WAS THEN ISOLATED BETWEEN AM 32 AND AM 35 AND THE REMAINING PRODUCTS WERE FLARED.  ONCE THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE, THE LINE WAS EXPOSED TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF EXCAVATION TO CUT-OUT AND REPLACE THE PIPE.  THE LINE WAS PURGED AND RESTARTED ON 11/8/2012.    PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS  THE CUT-OUT SECTION WAS SENT TO A LAB FOR EXAMINATION.  PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE PIPE CUT-OUT VIA MACRO-SECTIONING DETERMINED THERE ARE NO LAMINATIONS, SEGREGATIONS, AND / OR ANOMALIES WITHIN THE BODY OF THE PIPE.  PRE & POST INCIDENT NON-DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION VERIFIED WALL THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS OF THE PIPE WERE WITHIN THE APPROVED PARAMETERS.  PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS USING A MICROMETER OF THE PIPE WERE CONDUCTED AFTER SECTIONING ALSO CONFIRMED THE WALL THICKNESS WAS ACCEPTABLE.  BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH THE WELDING INSPECTOR AND WELDERS AS WELL AS REVIEWING THE DATA SUBMITTED BY THE WELDING INSPECTOR, THE WELDERS WERE NOT BEING FULLY MONITORED DURING THE WELDING OPERATION. IT HAS ALSO BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE WELDERS WERE WELDING OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIED PARAMETER RANGES.  SEVERAL MACRO-SECTIONS WERE TAKEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED FROM AREAS BOTH OUTSIDE AND OF CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION.  THE PHOTOGRAPHS INDICATE THAT PREVIOUS PASSES FROM THE RESPONSIBLE WELDER WERE WELDED WITHIN ACCEPTABLE WELDING PARAMETERS.  AS THE MACRO-SECTIONS MOVED CLOSER TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION IT CAN BE NOTED THAT THE OVERALL ENERGY INPUTTED INTO THE PIPE REGION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS PASSES.  A FINAL REPORT IS PENDING FROM THE LAB ANALYSIS.    METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS FINDINGS  THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONCLUDED ""THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS BURN-THROUGH IS THE POOR WELDING PRACTICE OF THE SUBJECT WELDER.  HE USED EXCESSIVE HEAT INPUT IN HIS WELDING OPERATIONS.  HE CONSISTENTLY DEPOSITED LARGE BEADS AND PENETRATED DEEP INTO THE PIPE.  THIS WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN THE LAST ROD HE DEPOSITED.""

THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR FOUND THE LEAK DURING AN OPERATIONAL ROUND AND WAS ABLE TO SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATE THE DELAWARE CONNECTOR PIPELINE SYSTEM (DCPL) WITHIN MINUTES.  FOLLOWING ISOLATION, EMPCO ENGINEERING CALCULATED THE ESTIMATED RELEASE VOLUME TO BE 9.3 BARRELS.  THE VALVE BODY THERMAL RELIEF SYSTEM ON MOV-508 WAS REPLACED WITH STAINLESS-STEEL TUBING THAT IS LIGHTER AND LESS BRITTLE, AND BRACING WAS ADDED TO REDUCE FATIGUE STRESS FROM VIBRATION.  PRIOR TO RESTARTING THE PIPELINE, EMPCO OPERATIONS AND ENGINEERING INSPECTED THE PIPELINE MANIFOLD FOR FITTINGS OF SIMILAR DESIGN AND MATERIALS.  THESE FITTINGS WERE REPLACED.  THE DCPL PIPELINE SYSTEM WAS RESTARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 21:30 ON 8/3/22.      CLEANUP EFFORTS (ALL ON OPERATOR CONTROLLED PROPERTY):  A VACUUM TRUCK WAS DEPLOYED, TO REMOVE ALL FREE STANDING OIL.  ABSORBENT PADS WERE USED TO WIPE AND CLEAN ALL OIL FROM SURROUNDING PIPING.  ALL CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AND PLACED IN ROLL OFF BINS THAT WERE PROFILED AND SENT TO AN APPROVED WASTE SITE.      KEY INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:  THE VALVE BODY THERMAL RELIEF SYSTEM ON TOP OF MOV-508 WAS THE PROPER MATERIAL (316 SS) AND INSTALLED ACCORDING TO DESIGN PRACTICES.

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK IN CPL'S MIDLAND STATION NEAR MIDLAND, TEXAS, IN MIDLAND COUNTY, TEXAS. CPL DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE THE MTF TERMINAL PUMP P-A1, ARCO METER #2 STRAINER AND PROMPTLY ISOLATED THE LEAK. FIVE (5) BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED AND RECOVERED. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.    CPL REPORTED THE LEAK TO TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION, OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY AT 12:06PM CST ON NOVEMBER 6, 2021.    AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING, THE REPAIR HAS BEEN SCHEDULED AND THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED PENDING THE SAMPLE EXAMINATIONS. THE RESULTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK, PREVENTATIVE AND MITIGATIVE MEASURES (P&M), AND UPDATES TO COST, IF APPLICABLE, WILL BE SUBMITTED VIA SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT(S).    SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT FILED ON DECEMBER 14, 2021:  CPL'S DETAILED INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT UNDER-DEPOSIT MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION (MIC) CAUSED THE FAILURE. THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE WATER DROP-OUT, SOLID DEPOSITS, AND PARAFFIN ACCUMULATION ON THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE STRAINER DRAIN PIPE, WHICH RESULTED IN INTERNAL CORROSION PITS THAT WEAKENED THE THREADED SECTION OF THE DRAIN PIPE UNTIL THE THREADS BROKE DURING NORMAL OPERATION. A PREVIOUS PERIOD OF STAGNANT CONDITIONS IN THE STATION PIPING ALLOWED WATER, SOLIDS, AND PARAFFIN TO DEPOSIT IN THE STRAINER DRAIN PIPE, AND A BACTERIA COLONY FORMED A MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION PIT. THE CORROSION RATE WITHIN THE PITS INCREASED DUE TO A GALVANIC COUPLE BETWEEN THE IRON SULFIDE AND IRON MAGNETITE COMPOUNDS, VERIFIED BY LAB ANALYSIS, AND THE STEEL PIPE. THE PARAFFIN ACCUMULATION PREVENTED THE INCOMING OIL THAT WAS TREATED WITH CORROSION MITIGATION AND BIOCIDE CHEMICALS FROM REACHING THE BACTERIA COLONY AND THE IRON SULFIDE AND DEPOSITS, THEREBY PREVENTING THE NORMAL ACTION OF THE CHEMICALS. IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THIS CORROSION ON THE STRAINER DRAIN PIPE WAS NOT RELATED TO THE CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF THE CRUDE OIL OR TO ANY UNEXPECTED CORROSIVENESS OF THE CRUDE OIL. RECORDS SHOW THAT THE CRUDE OIL WAS UNIFORMLY TREATED WITH CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS AND BIOCIDES, BUT THE INCIDENT INSPECTION AND LAB ANALYSIS PROVED THAT THE CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS WERE PREVENTED FROM REACHING THE BIOFILM BY A LAYER OF WAXY PARAFFIN.    THE FOLLOWING WILL OCCUR AS PART OF THE P&M MEASURE:  1. AN EVALUATION OF MIDLAND STATION PIPELINE AND THE SUBSETS A THROUGH C.  A) IDENTIFY ALL PIPING AT MIDLAND STATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY PREVIOUS PERIODS OF STAGNANT OR LOW FLOW CONDITIONS.  B) DETERMINE WHICH LINES WILL BE REQUIRED FOR CURRENT AND FORESEEABLE OPERATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS.  C) PRIORITIZE PIPING BASED OPERATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS.  2. MITIGATE POTENTIAL INTERNAL CORROSION DAMAGE AND REMOVE UNDERUTILIZED PIPING FROM SERVICE FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF STEP 1.   A) REMOVE LOW FLOW PIPING FROM SERVICE THAT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED FOR ROUTINE OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD BE A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT REMOVAL.  B) REPLACE LOW FLOW PIPING THAT WILL BE REQUIRED FOR ROUTINE OPERATIONS. (PIPELINE REPLACEMENTS WILL BE PLANNED FOR FUTURE EXECUTION DEPENDING ON SCOPE OF   WORK.)  C) DEVELOP AN ENHANCED FLUSHING PROGRAM THAT WOULD INCLUDE PARAFFIN SOLVENTS AND BIOCIDES FOR PIPING REMAINING IN THE FLUSHING PROGRAM.",11458.046793760832,0.0,285.0,16.140350877192983,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK IN CPL'S DORA ROBERTS STATION IN MIDLAND COUNTY, TEXAS. CPL DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE THE DORA ROBERT WARSAN FIELD PIG LAUNCHER BYPASS AND IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE LEAK. HOWEVER, 0.83 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.    THE ASSOCIATED PIPING IS CLASSIFIED AS A ""REPORTING REGULATED-ONLY GATHERING LINE."" CPL'S REPAIRS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND THE INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY. SAMPLES HAVE BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY. FOLLOWING RETURN OF THE RESULTS AND THE INVESTIGATION, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL FOLLOW.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED ON DECEMBER 16, 2021:  THE COST HAS BEEN UPDATED AND THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION INCIDENT NUMBER IS 2533.    CPL'S ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT INCORRECT OPERATIONS CAUSED THE INTERNAL CORROSION LEAK ON THE DORA ROBERTS TRUNK B (WARSAN) PIG LAUNCHER BYPASS PIPING. CPL PROCEDURES REQUIRE THE BYPASS VALVE BE RETURNED TO THE NORMAL OPEN POSITION AFTER LAUNCHING THE MAINTENANCE PIG. THE STAGNANT CONDITIONS OCCURRING IN THE LAUNCHER BYPASS ARE DUE TO THE BYPASS VALVE REMAINING CLOSED DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS. WITH NO PRODUCT FLOWING THROUGH THE LAUNCHER BYPASS, ACCUMULATION OF WATER AND SOLIDS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASED CORROSION RATE. THE SOLIDS DEPOSITS CAUSED A GALVANIC COUPLE BETWEEN THE DEPOSITS AND THE STEEL PIPE. THE SOLID DEPOSITS PREVENTED THE CORROSION MITIGATION CHEMICALS FROM REACHING THE STEEL SURFACE, THEREBY PREVENTING THE NORMAL ACTION OF THE CHEMICALS.    AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT RETRAINING ON THE 'LAUNCHING AND RECEIVING SCRAPER' PROCEDURAL STEPS WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE OPERATING AREA. REPAIRS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND NO FURTHER P&M MEASURES ARE NEEDED.     SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED ON JANUARY 03, 2022:  UPDATED PART A. 12.A.

THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED BY PERSONNEL ON LOCATION AND FLOW WAS SHUT DOWN FROM THE INCOMING PIPELINE AT APPROXIMATELY 09:50. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30, MEDALLION RESPONSE PERSONNEL DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM BURIED 8IN RELIEF LINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30, MEDALLION HAD THE RELIEF LINE ISOLATED AND CONTROL ROOM WAS ABLE TO SAFELY RESUME DELIVERIES FROM THE STATION. EMERGENCY ONE CALLS WERE MADE AND HYDROVAC EXCAVATION WAS USED TO UNEARTH THE 8IN RELIEF LINE. THE LEAK WAS FOUND AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION, AND A PLIDCO CLAMP+SLEEVE (TYPE B SLEEVE) WAS INSTALLED AS A REPAIR TO THE LINE, AND THE FACILITY HAS RESUMED FULL NORMAL OPERATIONS AT APPROXIMATELY 14:30 MARCH 6, 2021.     TO PREVENT RECURRENCE MEDALLION WILL INSTALL PIPING TO ALLOW FLUSHING CAPABILITIES TO PREVENT STAGNANT OIL IN THE RELIEF LINE BY JULY 15, 2021.    THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE RELEASED CRUDE OIL WAS 1.5 BBLS.  DURING REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, MEDALLION HAS DETERMINED THE RELEASED VOLUME TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30 BBLS.  ALL 30 BBLS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED BY REMOVING FREE STANDING OIL AND EXCAVATION AND REMEDIATION OF AFFECTED SOIL.  FURTHER REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES ARE ON HOLD, AS MEDALLION DETERMINES IF THE RELIEF LINE CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE TO ALLOW A MEANS OF EXCAVATION OTHER THAN HAND DIGGING AROUND THE IN-SERVICE PIPING.  REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY JULY 15, 2021.  -----------------  UPDATE(12/17/21): ALL REMEDIATION OF THE AFFECTED SOIL HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE REMEDIATION WERE MORE COSTLY THAN INITIALLY ESTIMATED AND THE TOTAL COST OF THE ACCIDENT EXCEEDED $50,000 DUE RECOVERING THE AFFECTED SOIL.  NO TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS MADE TO NRC AS THE INITIAL COST WAS EXPECTED TO BE BELOW THE IMMEDIATELY REPORTABLE CRITERIA.      AS A FURTHER MEANS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE, MEDALLION ABANDONED AND REMOVED THE 8 IN RELIEF LINE THAT WAS FOUND LEAKING.  A NEW ABOVE GROUND SECTION OF PIPING WAS INSTALLED IN AUGUST 2021.

THE SITE IS BEING REMEDIATED BY REMOVING ALL CONTAMINATED SOIL. ESTIMATED RELEASE TOTAL IS 350 GALLONS, ALL FROM THE SOIL VOLUME CALCULATION. THERE WAS NO MEASURABLE PRODUCT CONTAINED IN WATER REMOVED FROM THE SITE, BUT THERE WAS SOME PRODUCT OBSERVED ON THE GROUNDWATER. APPROXIMATELY 2,700 TONS OF SOIL WILL BE EXCAVATED AND TO DATE 130,000 GALLONS OF WATER HAS BEEN HAULED OFF FOR TREATMENT. SOIL AND WATER ARE BEING TREATED AT LOCAL, APPROVED FACILITIES. GROUNDWATER WAS IMPACTED AND MONITORING WELLS WILL BE INSTALLED TO FACILITATE SITE CLOSURE. THERE WERE NO IMPACTS TO WILDLIFE.    6/20/16 SUPPLEMENT IS TO UPDATE ESTIMATED VOLUME RELEASED AND VOLUME RECOVERED BASED ON ACTUAL REMEDIATION RESULTS.  INCIDENT ANALYSIS HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND PLANS ARE UNDERWAY TO REMOVE THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT WILL UNDERGO METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS LATER IN THE YEAR.  A TOTAL OF 7,026 TONS OF SOIL WAS EXCAVATED FROM THE SITE. THE AVERAGE CONCENTRATION OF GRO AND DRO IN THE SOIL WAS 216 MG/KG AND 40 MG/KG RESPECTIVELY. THE FINAL CALCULATED VOLUME OF PETROLEUM CONTAINED IN THE SOIL REMOVED IS 576 GALLONS. SINCE NO MEASURABLE PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED IN THE RECOVERED GROUNDWATER, THE FINAL RELEASE VOLUME IS 576 GALLONS.      THIS REPORT IS BEING FINALIZED WITH CAUSE DETERMINED FROM METALURGICAL ANALYSIS. PER ASSET INTEGRITY AND THE REPORT, THE FAILURE MODE WAS FATIGUE CRACKS WITHIN AN AREA WHERE A DENT WAS PRESENT WITH SIGNIFICANT CORROSION (UP TO 35%) UNDER AN A SLEEVE WITH SHRINK SLEEVES ON THE END THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 2005.

SHORTLY AFTER THE DESC FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AND TOOK CONTROL OF THE AREA.    THE THIRD PARTY EXCAVATOR, A SUBCONTRACTOR OF THE COMPANY DOING WORK ON THE INTERSTATE, HAD GOUGED THE 6-IN STEEL, MEDIUM PRESSURE MAIN. THE EXCAVATOR DID NOT HAVE A CLEAR LOCATE TICKET. IN ADDITION, THE EXCAVATOR STATED THEY ASSUMED THE MAIN WAS ABANDONED. THE CONTRACTOR HAD SPOTTED THE MAIN AND FULLY EXPOSED IT BEFORE PROCEEDING TO PULL IT OUT OF THE GROUND.     A NEARBY VALVE WAS CLOSED TO REDUCE THE LEAK RATE, THOUGH THE LINE STILL LEAKED AS IT WAS TWO-WAY FED. THE LEAK WAS STOPPED BY INSTALLING A STOPPER FITTING AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30 PM. THE DAMAGED PORTION OF PIPE WAS ALREADY SCHEDULED TO BE ABANDONED AT A LATER DATE. AFTER THE LEAK WAS STOPPED AND REPAIRS WERE MADE ON JULY 8, THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS ABANDONED. DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE, AND THE AMOUNT OF GAS THAT WAS ESCAPING THE DECISION WAS MADE TO SHUT DOWN AUGUSTA RD AND I-20 (BOTH DIRECTIONS OF TRAFFIC). THE INTERSTATE WAS SHUT DOWN DUE TO CARS DRIVING BY AND SPREADING THE PLUME OF GAS. GAS BLEW FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 HOURS AND THE INTERSTATE WAS SHUT DOWN FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 HOURS.     DESC MANAGEMENT DECIDED TO MAKE A PHMSA NOTIFICATION DUE TO THE CONCERN THAT OUR ESTIMATED LOST GAS WOULD EXCEED 3,000 MCF AND THAT THIS EVENT WOULD BE CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT IN NATURE.  THOUGH THIS THRESHOLD WAS NOT EXCEEDED, THE INCIDENT WAS SIGNIFICANT IN THE JUDGMENT OF DESC, BECAUSE OF THE DURATION OF STOPPING TRAFFIC FLOW ON A MAJOR ARTERY AND SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA ATTENTION.

THE ELECTROMAGNET (EM) DISTURBANCES IN THE UV AND IR RANGE TRIPPED THE HEAT AND LIGHT FLASH SENSORS AT THE STATION RESULTING IN THE ESD.  THE MANUFACTURE OF THE UV/IR SENSOR WAS CONTACTED TO DETERMINE IF THE SENSORS CAN BE ADJUSTED TO AVOID  EM DISTURBANCES FROM LIGHTNING EVENTS AS DISCUSSED BELOW.      NGPL OPERATIONS INSPECTED AND INVESTIGATED OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE STATION UV/IR SENSORS THAT CAUSED THE STATION 388 EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) BACK ON OCTOBER 12, 2014.  AFTER SUBMITTAL OF THE INITIAL REPORT, NGPL DETERMINED THE DIP SWITCH SETTINGS HAVE A FACTORY DEFAULT 4 SECOND DELAY BETWEEN THE WARNING AND ALARM.  IN ADDITION, NGPL DETERMINED THAT NO OTHER EQUIPMENT INSTALLED ON THIS SYSTEM WOULD IMPACT THE FACTORY-DEFAULT DELAY SETTINGS AND, UPON VERIFYING THE  UV/IR SYSTEM DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY TYPE OF POWER OUTAGE OR SURGE, THE SENSOR SIGNAL DELAY SETTINGS WERE INCREASED FROM FOUR (4) SECONDS TO EIGHT (8) SECONDS.  NGPL BELIEVES THAT INCREASING THE TIME DELAY SETTING WILL REDUCE FALSE ALARMS AND SHUTDOWNS CAUSED BY SEVERE LIGHTNING STORMS GOING FORWARD.      NGPL'S NORTH LANSING STORAGE FIELD HAS A MAXIMUM PEAK-DAY WITHDRAWAL RATE OF 1,240 MMCF PER DAY AND THE COMPRESSOR STATION NO. 388 NEAR LONGVIEW, TEXAS IS COMPRISED OF SEVEN COMPRESSOR UNITS TOTALING 36,000 HP, TWO CO2 EXTRACTION PLANTS AND FOUR DEHYDRATOR SKIDS.  THE NORMAL ESD RESTORATION PROCESS CAN TAKE UP TO THREE (3) HOURS OR MORE DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  FOLLOWING AN ESD EVENT WHERE THE CAUSE REMAINS UNKNOWN, CONSIDERABLY MORE TIME IS REQUIRED TO VERIFY THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT, TO CONFIRM THAT SAFETY DEVICES FUNCTIONED AS DESIGNED, AND THAT NO DAMAGE TO THE FACILITIES RESULTED BEFORE RESTARTING THE FACILITIES.  ON OCTOBER 12, 2014, IT TOOK NGPL APPROXIMATELY FIVE (5) HOURS TO VERIFY THE CAUSE OF THE ESD AND DETERMINE THAT NO DAMAGE EXISTED TO ANY OF THE FACILITIES BEFORE BRINGING THE ENTIRE STATION BACK INTO SERVICE.

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK IN CPL'S SEMINOLE STATION LOCATED NEAR SEMINOLE IN GAINES COUNTY, TEXAS. THE CPL EMPLOYEE DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS ON THE 6'' BYPASS LINE FOR A METER SKID. THE METER SKID WAS ISOLATED AND THE BYPASS LINE WAS TEMPORARILY REMOVED WHILE WAITING FOR PERMANENT REPAIRS. FIVE (5) BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED AND RECOVERED DURING THE PROCESS. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT. CPL'S INVESTIGATION IS STILL PENDING AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL FOLLOW UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION. THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL INCLUDE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AND ASSOCIATED P&M MEASURES.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILED ON JANUARY 11, 2022:  CPL'S DETAILED INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT UNDER-DEPOSIT CORROSION RESULTED IN A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT IN THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE WEST SEMINOLE TO SEMINOLE METER SKID 6"" BYPASS PIPING. THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE: THE ABSENCE OF A VALVE TO ISOLATE THE BYPASS DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS, STAGNANT CONDITIONS, AND WATER AND SOLIDS DEPOSITS AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE BYPASS. CPL OPERATIONS REPORTED THAT THE VALVE ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE 6"" BYPASS REMAINED CLOSED DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS AS IS REQUIRED TO MEASURE THE FLOW OF PRODUCT THROUGH THE CORIOLIS METER, AND NO VALVE EXISTS ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE BYPASS PIPING. THE ABSENCE OF A VALVE ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE METER SKID 6"" BYPASS PIPING PREVENTED ISOLATION OF THE BYPASS DURING NORMAL OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF A VALVE ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE METER SKID, THE BYPASS FILLED WITH CRUDE OIL AND STAGNANT CONDITIONS OCCURRED DURING OPERATION. STAGNANT CONDITIONS ALLOWED WATER AND SOLIDS TO DEPOSIT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE BYPASS, AND THE CORROSION RATE INCREASED UNDER THE SOLIDS DEPOSIT. THE PARAFFIN DEPOSITS PREVENTED THE CORROSION MITIGATION CHEMICALS FROM REACHING THE STEEL SURFACE, THEREBY PREVENTING THE NORMAL ACTION OF THE CHEMICALS. CPL DETERMINES THAT UNDER-DEPOSIT CORROSION RESULTED IN A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT IN THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE WEST SEMINOLE TO SEMINOLE METER SKID 6"" BYPASS PIPING. IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THIS CORROSION ON THE STATION PIPING WAS NOT RELATED TO THE CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF THE CRUDE OIL OR TO ANY UNEXPECTED CORROSIVENESS OF THE CRUDE OIL. RECORDS SHOW THAT THE CRUDE OIL WAS UNIFORMLY TREATED WITH CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS AND BIOCIDES, BUT THE INCIDENT INSPECTION AND LAB ANALYSIS PROVED THAT THE CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS WERE PREVENTED FROM REACHING THE BIOFILM BY A LAYER OF WAXY PARAFFIN.    IN ORDER TO PREVENT RECURRENCE, CPL EVALUATED THE NON-REGULATED, GATHERING METER BYPASS PIPING AND DETERMINED THAT CURRENT OPERATIONS DID NOT SUPPORT A PERMANENT REPLACEMENT.

OPERATIONS MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED  AT 1930, TANK WAS IMMEDIATELY EVACUATED, ISOLATED  AND LOCKED OUT.   NO OTHER NOTIFICATIONS WERE REQUIRED AT THAT  TIME.   FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND CLEAN-UP  BEGAN IN THE FOLLOWING  MORNING.  EXCAVATION  AND ANALYSIS OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL DETERMINED THAT LESS THAN A GALLON OF PRODUCT  (.23) WAS IN THE VISIBLE AFFECTED  AREA. NO FREE PHASE PRODUCT  WAS FOUND IN THE EXCAVATION. THE TANK WAS CLEANED AND AN  INVESTIGATION BEGAN TO DISCOVER THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.   WELDS ON TANK FLOOR WERE VACUM TESTED AND NO DEFECT WAS DETECTED.    A HELIUM  TEST  WAS PERFORMED WHICH INDICATED  THE POTENTIAL AREA OF THE LEAK. MAGNETIC PARTICAL EXAMANINATION OF THE AREA,DISCOVERED A CRACK IN THE TANK FLOOR. ON  4/24/13, COUPONS WERE CUT IN THE TANK FLOOR TO PROVIDE  OBSERVATION HOLES TO DETERMINE CONDITIONS  UNDER  THE FLOOR.   THE MAJORITY OF OBSERVATION HOLES CONTAINED  CLEAR WATER.   ON THE EVENING OF 4/24/13, A THIN LAYER OF PRODUCT  (LESS THAN 1/8-INCH THICK)  WAS OBSERVED FLOATING  ON TOP OF THE WATER UNDER  THE TANK FLOOR NEAR THE SUMP.   APPROXIMATELY 142 GALLONS OF WATER AND 1 GALLON OF PRODUCT  WAS REMOVED  BY VACUUM TRUCK.   NO MEASUREABLE THICKNESS  OF PRODUCT  REAPPEARED IN ANY OF THE OBSERVATION HOLES.  THE MORNING  OF 4/25/13 THE PROJECT MANAGER AND DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER (DEM) DETERMINED THAT, DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION, THE $50,000 THRESHOLD WOULD BE MET.  THE RELEASE VOLUME  OF 20 GALLONS WAS ESTIMATED AT THAT TIME BASED UPON OBSERVED  CONDITIONS, THE AMOUNT  RECOVERED,AND AN ESTIMATE AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE CONTAINED  IN THE SAND LAYER BELOW THE FLOOR, AND THE ABSENCE OF CONTAMINATION OR PRODUCT  DETECTED  WITHIN  SOIL BORINGS  ADVANCED BELOW THE CLAYMAX  LINER UNDER THE TANK.   AT 8:56 ON 4/25/2013 AN NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE BY THE CONTROL CENTER DUE TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF $50,000 OR MORE.  AT 9:52  DEM NOTIFIED  ADEM. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES WERE CONDUCTED UNDER THE TANK FLOOR TO CONFIRM  THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION AND THE ESTIMATED RELEASE VOLUME.     APPROXIMATELY 128 TONS OF IMPACTED SOIL WERE REMOVED FROM BELOW THE TANK FLOOR AND SENT OFF SITE FOR DISPOSAL IN FEBRUARY 2014.  LABORATORY RESULTS INDICATE THAT 2 GALLONS OF THE RELEASED PRODUCT WERE CONTAINED IN THE IMPACTED SOIL.  THE UPDATED RELEASE VOLUME OF 3 GALLONS IS BASED ON THE VOLUME OF PRODUCT CONTAINED IN IMPACT SOIL AND THE 1 GALLON OF FREE PRODUCT RECOVERED DURING THE INITIAL RESPONSE.",12517.0,1.0,18.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,13.745,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS IN THE OPEN EXCAVATION AT THE TIME OF THE IGNITION. THE FIRE WAS IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED BY THE SECOND CREW MEMBER. THE CREW MEMBER SUBJECTED TO THE IGNITION IMMEDIATELY EXITED THE EXCAVATION. HE THEN REMOVED HIS NOMEX HOOD AND OTHER FIRE RESISTANT CLOTHING AND SAFETY APPAREL. HE WAS GIVEN FIRST AID AND 911 WAS CALLED.      AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF INCIDENT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AND CAN NOT ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE WITH ANY REASONALBLE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.     COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO'S THIRD PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THERE WERE TWO POTENTIAL SOURCES OF IGNITION IN THE EXCAVATION AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; A PNEUMATIC SCALER AND AN ELECTRIC WATER PUMP.  THE DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRIC WATER PUMP'S WIRING AND PROTECTIVE BOOT ALLOWED ARCING WHICH IS LIKELY THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THIS INCIDENT.  THERE IS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THE CONDITION OF THE PROTECTIVE BOOT WAS COMPROMISED PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO INC. HAS PROHIBITED THE USE OF THESE WATER PUMPS BY ALL REPAIR CREWS AND IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A REPLACEMENT WATER PUMP WHICH IS NOT ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN.

(CPL) BRADEN TO MIDKIFF 8'' PIPELINE NEAR MIDKIFF, TEXAS, RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF CONTAINMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 130 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL. THE CRUDE OIL FILLED THE BORING EXCAVATION WHERE 110 BARRELS WERE RECOVERED BY VACUUM TRUCKS, AND THE REMAINING 20 BARRELS WERE RECOVERED BY SOIL REMEDIATION. CPL REPAIRED THE PIPELINE AND RETURNED IT TO SERVICE AT 02:36 ON JUNE 15, 2018. NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACCIDENT, AND SOIL REMEDIATION IS COMPLETE.    UPON COMPANY PERSONNEL ARRIVING ONSITE AT 10:40 ON JUNE 12, 2018, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AN EXCESS OF 5 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED. IT WAS NOT DETERMINED TO BE CPL'S PIPELINE UNTIL EXCAVATION WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMPLETED AT 13:02 TO ASCERTAIN THAT AMONG THE FLOW LINES AND UNMARKED PIPELINES IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY IT WAS CPL'S LINE THAT WAS STRUCK. PURSUANT TO THIS CONFIRMATION THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS CALLED AT 13:25.    THE NRC REPORT NUMBER 1215060 CORRESPONDS TO THE INITIAL TELEPHONIC REPORT FOR THIS ACCIDENT, AND NRC REPORT NUMBER 1215261 CORRESPONDS TO THE 48 HOUR UPDATE REPORT. TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION JOB NUMBER 134998 CORRESPONDS TO THIS ACCIDENT.    CPL CORRECTLY MARKED THE 8'' PIPELINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ONE CALL PROCEDURES. HOWEVER, PRIOR TO THE BORING ACTIVITY, THE CONTRACTOR INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED A 3'' STEEL FLOW LINE AS THE BRADEN TO MIDKIFF 8'' PIPELINE DURING POT-HOLING. THE CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO BORE UNDER THE MISIDENTIFIED PIPELINE AND STRUCK THE MARKED BRADEN TO MIDKIFF PIPELINE IN THE 3 O' CLOCK POSITION AT A DEPTH OF 7'10'' RESULTING IN THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.    SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT FILED ON AUGUST 1, 2018:  IN RESPONSE TO PHMSA'S SUGGESTED CHANGES, CPL UPDATED A4 FROM 10:40 AM TO 10:17 AM TO REFLECT THE EARLIEST KNOWN TIME THAT A REPORTING CRITERIA MAY HAVE BEEN MET. CPL UPDATED A7 FROM 13:25 TO 13:48 TO CORRESPOND WITH THE CORRECT TIME OF THE CALL TO THE NRC. CPL ALSO CHANGED A9 FROM 130 BARRELS TO 890 BARRELS TO INCLUDE THE VOLUME OF CRUDE OIL DRAINED FROM THE BRADEN TO MIDKIFF PIPELINE PRIOR TO REPAIRS BEING MADE.    PHMSA REQUESTED THE COSTS IN D8 BE VALIDATED. UPON FURTHER REVIEW, CPL UPDATED THE COSTS TO INCLUDE THE INVOICES RECEIVED SINCE THE ORIGINAL REPORT FILING. OVERALL, THE TOTAL COSTS TO THE OPERATOR INCREASED FROM $55,320 TO $61,610.

AFTER INSTALLING A REDUCING ASSEMBLY THAT ALLOWS A TOOL TO BE LOWERED IN THE CASING PROVIDED BY THE CONTRACTOR, BOTH PARTIES PROCEEDED TO TEST THE COMPLETED ASSEMBLY. THE WELLHEAD MASTER VALVE WAS PARTIALLY OPENED TO EQUALIZE PRESSURE. THE CONTRACTOR NOTED THAT THE MASTER VALVE WAS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE AS EXPECTED DUE TO RELATIVELY HIGH-PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL ACROSS THE VALVE. THEY REPORTED THE PRESSURE WAS 1,140 PSIG AT 0900 HOURS. NO GAS COULD BE HEARD FLOWING THROUGH THE VALVE, BUT THE SUBCONTRACTOR INDICATED THERE WAS A SLIGHT LEAK BUBBLING BETWEEN THE COMPANION FLANGE AND THE REDUCING FITTING, THEREFORE, BOTH THE CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR CLOSED THE MASTER VALVE AND THEN OPERATED A BLEED-OFF VALVE, RELEASING THE PRESSURE BUILDUP.    THE LEAK WAS REMEDIATED BY TIGHTENING THE REDUCING FITTING WITH A PIPE WRENCH BY APPROXIMATELY A HALF-TURN ON THE FITTING. WITH THE LEAK REMEDIATED, THE MASTER VALVE WAS SLOWLY OPENED AGAIN WITH DIFFICULTY. IT TYPICALLY TAKES 2-4 TURNS OF THE VALVE TO ACHIEVE FULL-OPEN STATUS, AFTER APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 TO 2 TURNS OF THE MASTER VALVE, THE ASSEMBLY FAILED. THE SIX PERSONNEL ON-SITE VACATED THE WORK AREA, THREE OF WHICH RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION DUE TO FACIAL ABRASIONS AND POTENTIAL HEARING LOSS.    ONCE THE AREA WAS SECURED AND NORTHERN NATURAL GAS EVALUATED THE SCENARIO, A WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR WAS TO MOBILIZE TO REMEDIATE THE VENTING GAS. THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR ARRIVED ON-SITE AT AND CONFERRED WITH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AT 2345 HOURS, AND DUE TO LACK OF DAYLIGHT AND PRESENCE OF NEARBY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES, IT WAS DECIDED TO RE-EVALUATE THE NEXT MORNING. AROUND 0700 ON JULY 16, 2021, THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR DELAYED THE RESPONSE EFFORT DUE TO POOR LIGHTING AND LIMITED VISIBILITY CAUSED BY EARLY MORNING FOG. ONCE THE FOG LIFTED, THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR ASSESSED THE SITE AND CLOSED THE MASTER VALVE AT 1001 HOURS ON JULY 16, 2021. IT WAS NOTED BY THE WELL CONTROL CONTRACTOR THAT THE MASTER VALVE HAD A SLIGHT LEAK AND WAS REMEDIATED BY INSTALLING A SECOND MASTER VALVE ABOVE THE ORIGINAL CONTAINING THE LEAK FULLY AT 1125 HOURS.    THE PRELIMINARY EVALUATION DETERMINED THE THREADED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COMPANION FLANGE AND REDUCING FITTING DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT THREAD ENGAGEMENT. THE INADEQUATE CONNECTION COULD NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT HYDRAULIC STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE NOR THE MECHANICAL STRENGTH TO RESIST THE BENDING MOMENT IMPARTED BY THE SUSPENDED WIRELINE ASSEMBLY.    PRELIMINARY LAB ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BETWEEN AUGUST 30, 2021 ' SEPTEMBER 1, 2021 FOUND THE COMPANION FLANGE, SWAGE PIN, WAS UNDERSIZE BY 0.0325 INCHES AND THE REDUCING FITTING WAS OVER SIZED BY 0.0305 INCHES. THE THREADS ON THE COMPANION FLANGE WERE ALSO SHORT LENGTH 2-INCHES INSTEAD OF THE FULL LENGTH OF 4-INCHES, WHICH LIMITED THE NUMBER OF THREADS AVAILABLE FOR FULL ENGAGEMENT ACROSS 4-INCHES. THIS LACK OF AVAILABLE ENGAGEMENT AND COMPONENTS OUTSIDE ACCEPTABLE TOLERANCE, PREVENTED THE ASSEMBLY FROM PROPERLY HOLDING TOGETHER UNDER THE DESIGNED PRESSURE.",195.0,0.0,1440.0,79.16666666666666,1.0,0.0,1.0,25.315,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

ONLINE FLOW RECORDS SHOWED AN APPARENT 10X FLOW INCREASE AROUND AUGUST 23.  CIG HAD CHECKED ITS DELIVERY METER AND FOUND NOTHING ABNORMAL.  THE 50-MILE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WAS SYSTEMATICALLY ISOLATED AND CHECKED BY SECTION, AND CIG NOTED AN ABRUPT DROP IN FLOW.  THE LAST SECTION ISOLATED WAS THE HIGH-PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN COLORADO THAT FEEDS THE TOWN SYSTEMS IN COWDREY AND WALDEN.NEXT DAY WE PINPOINTED LOW PRESSURE ON THE 2-INCH SECTION THAT HELPS FEED WALDEN. THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL SUPPLY LINE TO WALDEN, BUILT CA 1958 OF COATED STEEL 2"" PIPE.  WE HAD FOUND AND FIXED A CORROSION PINHOLE LEAK ON THIS SEGMENT EARLIER IN JULY, THE ONLY LEAK FOUND IN 20+ YEARS ON ANY PIPELINE IN COLORADO.  THIS 17,000 FT SEGMENT WAS LOOPED CA 1979 WITH A 3"" COATED STEEL LINE, PARALLEL AND ABOUT 10 FT SOUTHEAST. THE 2"" SECTION WAS ISOLATED AND QUICKLY PRESSURED DOWN.  LATER, GAS WAS REINTRODUCED AND A LEAK SURVEY DONE IN THE AREA AROUND THE PREVIOUS LEAK.  THE NEWER LEAK WAS DETECTED ABOUT 180 FT SW OF THE PREVIOUS REPAIR, RUNNING ALONG A SHALLOW SAGEBRUSH WASH. WITH THIS SEGMENT SHUT DOWN AND THE 3"" LOOP CARRYING THE LOAD, WE EXCAVATED THE NEW LEAK AREA ON NOVEMBER 2, INTENDING A REPAIR.  THE PIPE AND COATING LOOKED IDENTICAL TO THAT WITH THE NEARBY LEAK REPAIR, BUT WAS VERY SHALLOW.  THE EXCAVATED MATERIAL WAS MOSTLY BLACK, SMELLY LEAK DIRT INDICATIVE OF A LONG-TERM GAS LEAK. THE EXCAVATOR STRIPPED OUT THE PIPE FOR 60 FT, AND WE INTRODUCED A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS FROM THE NEARBY BLOCK VALVE.  THE EXPOSED & CLEANED-OFF PIPELINE DIDN'T LEAK.  BUT THE GAS DETECTOR PICKED UP GAS NEAR THE FRONT AND NORTH SIDE OF THE BACKHOE, WELL AWAY FROM THE EXPOSED 2"" AND THE SIDE AWAY FROM THE 3"" LOOP. AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, DIGGING OUT MORE LEAK DIRT, WE EVENTUALLY FOUND A SECOND STRING OF 2"" PIPE RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE EXPOSED LINE, ABOUT 7 FT NW AND 3.5 FT DEEPER.  WE STRIPPED OUT A 10-FT SECTION OF THIS NEWLY-DISCOVERED PIPE.  THE COATING WAS A COLD-APPLIED YELLOW TAPE WITH THICK BLACK MASTIC, LIKELY HAND-APPLIED WITH GOOD OVERLAPS AND NO WRINKLES. WE COULD FIND NO OBVIOUS DEFECTS OR HOLES, UNTIL GAS WAS INTRODUCED.  IN LESS THAN 5 SECONDS, THE SHORT SECTION APPEARED TO LEAK IN AT LEAST 4 PLACES, INCLUDING A PINKIE-SIZE HOLE IN THE TAPE AND THE PIPE ON THE BOTTOM.  ALTHOUGH THE TAPE LOOKED GOOD ON FIRST INSPECTION, THERE WERE SEVERAL DEEP MARKS AND DENTS, ALTHOUGH THE SOIL WAS ROCK-FREE, MOIST CLAY.  THE DEEP DENTS MAY HAVE BEEN MADE DURING INSTALLATION, WHEN THE PIPE WAS LOWERED IN WITH LOG CHAINS INSTEAD OF SOFTER PIPE SLINGS. THIS 3RD LINE IS NOT SHOWN ON ANY MAPS OR DESCRIBED IN ANY DOCUMENTS CONVEYED FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNER ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATURAL GAS TO THE TOWN IN 1995.  WITH 5 CORROSION LEAKS (DESPITE GOOD CP READINGS) IN 200 FT IN A FEW MONTHS; AND WITH LITTLE HYDRAULIC VALUE, WE DECIDED TO PERMANENTLY ABANDON THE 2-INCH SEGMENT.  WE CUT OUT AN 8-FT SECTION OF THE LEAKING PIPE, AND WELD-CAPPED BOTH ENDS OF THE 17,000 FT SEGMENT, WITH DOCUMENTATION THAT THIS SECTION CAN'T BE USED AGAIN. THIS LEAK WAS ABOUT 1.2 MILES FROM THE EDGE OF WALDEN.  THE NEAREST PUBLIC ROAD IS THE COUNTY RODEO & FAIRGROUNDS ABOUT 1/2 MILE AWAY, AND 0.9 MILE TO THE NEAREST RESIDENCE. WE BELIEVE THIS LEAK HAS PERSISTED FOR DECADES.  IT WAS NOT REPORTED BY THE PUBLIC, SINCE IT IS VERY REMOTE AND THE PREVAILING WIND GENERALLY BLOWS FROM THE SOUTHWEST, AWAY FROM ANY RESIDENCES OR ROADS. THE UTILITY HAD LEAK-SURVEYED THE 2 KNOWN PARALLEL LINES AS REQUIRED BY DOT PART 192.  THE VEHICLE-MOUNTED RIG WAS ALWAYS DRIVEN BETWEEN THE 2 PIPELINES THAT ARE ONLY 8 FT APART.  THE UNKNOWN LINE WAS ABOUT 12 FT OUTSIDE THE LEAK SURVEY PATH. WE BELIEVE OLD UNDETECTED PINHOLE LEAKS BLEW OUT WITH THE RE-PRESSURIZATION AFTER THE PREVIOUS REPAIR. NO INJURIES OR DEATHS RESULTED FROM THIS LEAK.

SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED PRODUCT ACCUMULATING AT THE BASE OF THE TANK.  APPROPRIATE NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE AND PRODUCT CONTAINMENT AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES WERE INITIATED.  THE TANK WAS EMPTIED AND PREPARED FOR INTERNAL INSPECTION.  INITIAL INTERNAL VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED A POSSIBLE CRACK IN THE TANK FLOOR NEAR THE SUMP WELL.  NDT INSPECTION OF THE ENTIRE TANK FLOOR HAS BEEN COMPLETED PENDING FINAL REPORT.  ALL CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE TANK DIKE AND REPLACED WITH CLEAN FILL.  MDEQ HAS BEEN ON SITE AND RECEIVED UPDATES ON SOIL REMOVAL ACTIVITY.    A FINAL OR SUPPLEMENTAL SPILL REPORT WILL BE FILED WITH PHMSA UPON DISCOVERY OF ANY NEW FINDINGS.      FINAL REPORT UPDATE -   THE RELEASE IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE STARTED ON 6 JANUARY 2019, BASED ON TANK VOLUME AND RELEASE CALCULATIONS.  THE RELEASE WAS DISCOVERED AT 17:10, ON 8 JANUARY 2019.  THE DECISION TO NOTIFY THE NRC WAS MADE AT 18:55 LOCAL TIME ON 8 JANUARY 2019 WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT RESPONSE AND REPAIR EFFORT WOULD EXCEED $50,000.    INCIDENT ANALYSIS (IA) WAS COMPLETED ON 20 MARCH 2019.  THE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THE TANK FLOOR DEVELOPED A CRACK IN A SUMP DIFFUSER LEG SUPPORT PLATE.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED.  HOWEVER, THE IA DID IDENTIFY TWO POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.  TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRACK AS FOLLOWS:    MATERIAL OR EQUIPMENT FAILURE: AN INSPECTION DISCOVERED THE SUMP DIFFUSER PLATE HAD DETACHED FROM THE TANK INTERIOR WALL DURING AN INTERNAL INSPECTION PERFORMED ON 22 AUGUST 2018.  THAN 2075 PROJECT RECORDS REVEAL THAT A NITROGEN PUSH CONDUCTED IN 2016 USED TANK 20175 AS THE NITROGEN BLOWDOWN POINT FOR A PIPE REPAIR PERFORM ON A NEARBY RIGHT OF WAY.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NITROGEN, VENTING THROUGH THE TANK, COULD HAVE MOVED THE DIFFUSER SUPPORT LEGS IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE WELDED SUPPORT PLATE.  MOVEMENT OF THE SUMP DIFFUSER LEG RESTING ON THE SUPPORT PLATE MAY ALSO HAVE CAUSED THE FLOOR TO FLEX ENOUGH TO AFFECT SOIL COMPACTION AROUND THE SUMP, CONTRIBUTING TO CRACK DEVELOPMENT.      LOSS OF SOIL COMPACTION: A VOID BETWEEN THE TANK FLOOR AND SOIL AROUND THE SUMP BOX WAS OBSERVED DURING TANK FLOOR REPAIRS.  THIS VOID MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING FLOOR REPLACEMENT CONSTRUCTION IN 2007.  LOSS OF SOIL COMPACTION OVER TIME COULD HAVE CAUSED THE WELD PLATE TO CRACK FROM METAL FATIGUE DURING TANK CYCLING.    THE TANK WAS REPAIRED AND RESTORED TO SERVICE.    ADDITIONALLY, THE VOLUME AND INCIDENT COST HAVE WERE UPDATED TO THE CORRECT VOLUME OF RELEASE AND COST OF REPAIRS.

THE PIPELINE IDENTIFIED AS LINE D-533, IS A TRANSMISSION LINE, 3-IN IN DIAMETER LOCATED IN WOOD COUNTY, OHIO, NEAR THE VILLAGE OF RISING SUN.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE REPORTED RELEASE WAS FOUND TO BE FROM A DAMAGED 2-IN PIPELINE APPARENTLY BY A THIRD PARTY (LANDOWNER) WHILE FARMING HIS LAND. THIS DAMAGE TO LINE D-533 CAUSED THE LOSS OF 270 CUSTOMERS THAT ARE SERVICED BY THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY (LDC) DOWNSTREAM OF THE FAILURE POINT.  ALL EFFORTS WERE MADE BY COLUMBIA AND THE LDC PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN MATERIAL FLOW TO THE LINE IN A SHORT TIMEFRAME.  AFTER PERFORMING THE NECESSARY ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT TO THE DAMAGED LINE, A PRE-TESTED PIPE WAS INSTALLED AND THE SERVICE TO LINE D-533 WAS RE-ESTABLISHED IN A SHORT TIMEFRAME.

THE LA STATE POLICE HAZMAT  HOT LINE,  NRC,  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND OTHER AGENCIES WERE  NOTIFIED.  THE OIL FROM THE NORTH LINE CRUDE PIPELINE WAS CONTAINED IN THE IMMEDIATE  AREA AND RECOVERY EFFORTS WERE INITIATED USING VACUUM TRUCKS, SKIMMERS AND ABSORBENT MATERIALS TO RECOVER  THE OIL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. AIR QUALITY MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED IN THE IMPACTED AREA AND CONFIRMED NO DANGER TO THE PUBLIC.  THE CLEANUP WAS COORDINATED WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE LOUISIANA OIL SPILL RESPONSE COORDINATOR'S OFFICE, THE LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THE AFFECTED PIPE WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AS PART OF A FULL INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,891 BARRELS OF OIL WAS PROVIDED TO REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  ONCE THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE, THE SPILL VOLUME ESTIMATE  AND RECOVERED AMOUNT WILL BE UPDATED.  TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED.

CUSTOMERS  WERE BEEN NOTIFIED AND EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY TO MINIMIZE  ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS.    METALLURGICAL AND MECHANICAL TESTING REVEALED THAT A MANUFACTURING DEFECT' NAMELY, AN INTERNAL HOOK CRACK ADJACENT TO THE SEAM WELD WAS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE RUPTURE.   ELEMENT REACHED ITS CONCLUSION BASED UPON: VISUAL EXAMINATION, ULTRASONIC TESTING, METALLOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION, HARDNESS TESTS, CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, TENSION TESTS, AND CHARPY TESTS.  VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE REVEALED A 'SMOOTH, FLAT FRACTURE ALONG THE INSIDE HALF OF THE FRACTURE FOR A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 4 INCHES, STARTING APPROXIMATELY 6-1/2 INCHES FROM THE GIRTH WELD.'   THE FLAT FRACTURE WAS 'PERPENDICULAR TO THE PIPE SURFACES AND TRANSITIONED TO THE SLANTED FRACTURE [FEATURE] FOR THE REMAINING 2-1/2 INCHES TO THE GIRTH WELD.'   THE FRACTOGRAPHY INDICATED THAT THE RUPTURE INITIATED IN THE SMOOTH, FLAT FRACTURE AND PROPAGATED IN BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM DIRECTIONS. THE CURVED PATH OF THE FRACTURE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF A HOOK-CRACK DEFECT.  THE DEPTH OF THE HOOK CRACK WAS 0.11 INCH, APPROXIMATELY 35-PERCENT OF THE NOMINAL WALL THICKNESS.  IN SUM, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE 2012 RUPTURE OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE WAS A 35-PERCENT THROUGH-WALL HOOK-CRACK MANUFACTURING DEFECT ADJACENT TO THE PIPE SEAM.        PART: A  9.

AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM, ON JUNE 13, 2020, DOMINION ENERGY NORTH CAROLINA RECEIVED A 911-CALL REPORTING AN EXPLOSION AT 1347 COURTLAND DRIVE IN RALEIGH, NC. 911 REPORTED TO DENC THAT AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF THE HOME AT 1347 COURTLAND. DENC CREWS DID NOT OBSERVE ANY FIRE AT THE HOUSE. A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR THE HOMEOWNER OF 1347 COURTLAND WAS REPORTEDLY INJURED AT THE SCENE WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED. AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, THE CONTRACTOR WAS IN THE CRAWL SPACE UNDERNEATH THE HOME PERFORMING WORK ON THE HOMEOWNER'S HVAC SYSTEM. THE CONTRACTOR WAS REPORTEDLY BURNED BY THE EXPLOSION AND TRANSPORTED TO THE LOCAL BURN HOSPITAL. FOUR NEIGHBORING HOMES, ALONG WITH 1347 COURTLAND, WERE ALL EVACUATED (I.E., 1345, 1347, 1349, 1401, 1403 COURTLAND). THE RESIDENTS OF 1401 AND 1403 COURTLAND WERE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES WITHIN DAYS OF THE INCIDENT. AS OF AUGUST 2020, THE RESIDENTS OF 1345 AND 1349 COURTLAND HAD RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES. THE HOME AT 1347 COURTLAND SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND IS NOT HABITABLE.    ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT, DENC DISCOVERED A NATURAL GAS LEAK NEAR THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE STEEL TAPPING TEE AND THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE THAT SERVED 1345 COURTLAND. THE RESPONDING DENC CREW STOPPED THE LEAK BY RUNNING THE TAPPING TEE CUTTER DOWN. AS A PRECAUTION, THE TAPPING TEE AT 1347 COURTLAND WAS ALSO SHUT OFF BY RUNNING DOWN THE TAPPING TEE PERFORATOR/STOP FOR THE SERVICE LINE. BOTH SERVICES WERE LATER DISCONNECTED, AND STEEL CAPS WERE WELDED ON. SUBSEQUENTLY, DENC EXPOSED THE MAIN IN FRONT OF 1345, 1347 AND 1349 COURTLAND AND VERIFIED THERE WERE NO LEAKS.    A PORTION OF THE STEEL TAPPING TEE AND PLASTIC SERVICE LINE TO 1345 COURTLAND WITH THE VERIFIED LEAK WAS REMOVED AND PRESERVED FOR FURTHER TESTING. A LEAK FLOW TEST USING COMPRESSED AIR WAS PERFORMED ON THE SUBJECT PIPE IN A LABORATORY SETTING ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020. AT 60.0 PSI, THE LEAK RATE WAS 66 SCFH OF AIR, WHICH CONVERTS TO APPROXIMATELY 89.2 SCFH OF NATURAL GAS. USING THIS LEAK RATE, DENC ESTIMATES THE AMOUNT OF LOST GAS TO BE 295.43 MCF AND THE COST OF LOST GAS TO BE $1,371.    DENC RETAINED INVESTIGATORS WHO EXAMINED THE SCENE. THESE INVESTIGATORS OBSERVED OXY-ACETYLENE TANKS LAYING ON THEIR SIDE IN THE CRAWL SPACE OF 1347 COURTLAND AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE INVESTIGATORS ASSESSED BLAST DYNAMICS AND OBSERVED ISOLATED BURN DAMAGE. SPECIFICALLY, THEY FOUND LITTLE TO NO FLAME PROPAGATION. THE PHOTOGRAPHS AFTER THE INCIDENT DEMONSTRATE THAT NEITHER THE WOOD JOISTS IN THE CRAWL SPACE NOR THE FOAM INSULATION WERE BURNED. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST IGNITION OF A DISCRETE AMOUNT OF GASEOUS FUEL. WHILE THE EXACT AMOUNT OF GAS CONSUMED IN THE INCIDENT IS INDETERMINABLE, DENC ESTIMATES THAT IT WAS LESS THAN 1 MCF. (NOTE: PART A.21C WILL ONLY ALLOW A MINIMUM OF 1 MCF TO BE ENTERED). THE INVESTIGATORS' GAS MIGRATION MODELING SUGGESTS THAT NEAR-ZERO GAS FLOW WOULD MIGRATE FROM THE SERVICE LINE FRACTURE TO THE FOUNDATION WALL OF THE HOME, EVEN WITH THE HIGHEST SIMULATED PERMEABILITY VALUES (I.E., 1.0X10-3 CM2).     IN LIGHT OF THE PHYSICAL FINDINGS AND GAS MIGRATION MODELING RESULTS, INVESTIGATORS QUESTIONED WHETHER OTHER POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS MAY HAVE LED TO THIS INCIDENT. SPECIFICALLY, THE OXY-ACETYLENE TANKS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT, WHICH WERE IN THE CRAWL SPACE WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS FIRST ARRIVED ON SCENE AND IN USE BY THE HVAC CONTRACTOR AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, LATER WENT MISSING AS OF AUGUST 3, 2020 AND HAVE NOT BEEN RECOVERED TO DATE. THE HVAC CONTRACTOR'S EMPLOYER CONFIRMED THAT THEY DID NOT MAINTAIN RECORDS FOR THE MISSING TANKS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT.    DENC CLASSIFIES THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT AS UNKNOWN (PART G8).  THIS CONCLUDES DENC'S INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT.

THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN IN THE VICINITY OF THE MANHOLE WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A LAB FOR TESTING AND INSPECTION.   THE TESTS DISCOVERED A CRACK IN THE PIPE APPROXIMATELY A HALF-BLOCK AWAY FROM THE MANHOLE.  THE CRACK WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE EXTERNAL LOADING FROM PASSING VEHICLES.

THE LEAK HAD STOPPED BY THE TIME COLONIAL PERSONNEL ARRIVED. AT 21:10 EDT, THE WOODBURY OM CALLED THE NJDEP HOTLINE TO REPORT THE LEAK (ASSIGNED CASE #04-27-2109-51). THE ESTIMATED RELEASE VOLUME GIVEN AT THAT TIME WAS 25 GALLONS. THE VOLUME WAS LATER REVISED TO 11 GALLONS, BASED ON ABSORBENT DIAPER COUNT, LABORATORY RESULTS FOR SOIL STOCKPILE, AND AN ESTIMATED STOCKPILE VOLUME/WEIGHT.  THE PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED IN THE FACILITY IN THE IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY TO THE RELEASE POINT. CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS CONSISTING OF EXCAVATING THE STAINED SURFACE SOIL AND GRAVEL, ABSORBENT PAD USE AND WIPING RESIDUAL PRODUCT FROM INFRASTRUCTURE STARTED IMMEDIATELY.

PRODUCT DRAINING WAS IMMEDIATELY STOPPED AND THE LINE WAS ISOLATED TO BEGIN INVESTIGATION.     DURING EXCAVATION OF IMPACTED SOILS, A 1.5 INCH DRAIN LINE WAS DISCOVERED THAT WAS NEITHER EXPOSED NOR TOUCHED DURING THE RECENT TIE-IN PROJECT AND WAS ALSO NOT IDENTIFIED ON TERMINAL DRAWINGS. IT APPEARED THIS LINE WAS STILL TIED INTO THE TERMINAL NETWORK OF DRAIN LINES THAT EVENTUALLY TIED INTO THE SUMP. FURTHER INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE PIPE/DRAIN LINE WAS LEFT UNCAPPED AND NOT ISOLATED FROM THE ACTIVE SUMP LINES.  BASED ON THE ELEVATION OF THE DRAIN LINE ON THE PROPERTY, AND THE TYPICAL FLOW THROUGH THE DRAIN LINES, THIS UN-CAPPED DRAIN LINE HAD NOT BEEN DISCOVERED PREVIOUSLY.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT A PREVIOUS OWNER-OPERATOR FROM WHOM MAGELLAN ACQUIRED THE SYSTEM IN 2013 DISCONNECTED THIS SEGMENT FROM OTHER DRAIN LINES, LEAVING THE END UNPLUGGED.

OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED BY GAS CONTROL TO THE SITE AND CONFIRMED DISCOVERY AT 11:27 AM LOCAL TIME.  THE STATION ESD EQUIPMENT FUNCTIONED AS INTENDED WITH A TOTAL OF 23,576 MSCF GAS VENTED TO ATMOSPHERE THROUGH A 4' BLOCK VENT VALVE DURING THE EVENT.    THE GAS LOSS DURING THIS EVENT WAS CONFIRMED TO BE A REPORTABLE EVENT TO THE NRC - REPORT NO. 1214945 AND TO THE TECQ.  A 48-HOUR UPDATE TO THE NRC - REPORT NO. 1215067 THE FOLLOWING DAY INCLUDING THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE FOR THE RELEASE LOCATION AND MAJOR CROSS STREETS.  THE NORMAL ESD VOLUME FOR THE STATION SHOULD ONLY BE 135 MSCF.    UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A MANUAL 2' BYPASS/LOADING VALVE LOCATED AT THE STATION DISCHARGE GAS BLOCK VALVE (VO-9113) WAS LEFT IN THE OPEN POSITION.  DURING NORMAL OPERATION, THE POSITION OF THIS VALVE SHOULD BE CLOSED.  HOWEVER, WITH THE 2-INCH VALVE IN THE OPEN POSITION, PIPELINE GAS WAS FREE TO BYPASS THE STATION ISOLATION VALVE VO-9113 AND ENTER THE ESD VENT PIPING CONTRIBUTING TO A REPORTABLE GAS RELEASE ABOVE THE NORMAL ESD VOLUME.      TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ESD ACTIVATION AND RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS, OPERATIONS COMPLETED AN INSPECTION OF THE ESD SYSTEM INCLUDING THE ALL OF THE ESD BREAK GLASS STATIONS, THE ESD PULL SWITCHES, THE FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM, THE GAS DETECTION SYSTEM, THE LOW SUCTION PRESSURE SWITCH, AND THE LOW INSTRUMENT AIR PRESSURE SWITCH.  THE INSPECTION DETERMINED THAT THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE WAS AN ELECTRICAL SHORT IN THE ESD BREAK GLASS STAND NO. 3 WIRE THAT TRIGGERED THE ACTIVATION OF THE ESD SYSTEM.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ESD WAS THE SEEPAGE OF RAINWATER INTO AN OPEN ELECTRICAL CONDUIT CONTACTING AN EXPOSED ELECTRICAL WIRE RESULTING IN AN ELECTRICAL SHORTAGE TO THE CASING; TRIGGERING THE STATION ESD SYSTEM.        CORRECTIVE ACTION INCLUDED REPLACING THE EXPOSED WIRE AND CONDUIT TO ELIMINATE THE SHORT ON THE NO. 3 ESD BREAK GLASS SWITCH STATION.  IN ADDITION OPERATIONS WILL REPLACE EXPOSED WIRES ON THE ESD SYSTEM AND SEAL OPEN CONDUITS TO PREVENT WATER FROM ENTERING THE ELECTRICAL CONDUITS TO PREVENT ELECTRICAL SHORTING OF THE ESD WIRING AND AVOID INADVERTENT ACTIVATION OF THE ESD SYSTEM.",11458.046793760832,0.0,1050.0,86.47619047619047,1.0,0.0,0.0,26.665,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A: WHEN THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE (PRV) WAS INSPECTED AFTER THE RELEASE NO DEBRIS WAS FOUND INSIDE OF THE PRV. THE AS FOUND SET POINT MATCHED THE PRESSURE ACHIEVED (954 PSI) SO THE PRV RELEASED AS SET.      Q: HAS THE SET POINT DRIFTED BEFORE?   A: THIS PRV RECEIVED ITS LAST ANNUAL INSPECTION ON 8/27/2019 AND THE AS FOUND SET POINT WAS 986 PSI. THE SET POINT WAS READJUSTED TO 988 AT THAT TIME. AT THE TIME, THE 2 PSI DRIFT WAS NOT CONSIDERED ENOUGH FOR CONCERN.      Q: WHAT PREVENTATIVE MEASURES ARE BEING TAKEN TO PREVENT THIS IN THE FUTURE?   A: THE PRV AT THIS RECEIPT POINT IS SPRING CONTROLLED. THROUGH OUR RESEARCH OF MANUFACTURE INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION WITH OPERATIONS, THE SPRING CONTROLLED PRVS SEEM TO BE MORE SUBJECT TO DRIFTING OF SET POINT AND RESEATING PRESSURES DURING RAPID PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS AND LOW TEMPERATURES.

OUTLET AT THE COOLIDGE CITY GATE.  THE COOLIDGE CITY GATE IS LOCATED AT 4600 COOLIDGE HWY., (OAKLAND COUNTY) ROYAL OAK, MICHIGAN.      AN INSTRUMENT MECHANIC (IM) WAS DISPATCHED AT APPROXIMATELY 04:52 AND ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 05:53 TO DISCOVER A FAILURE OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR (P2).   THE REGULATOR FAILURE CAUSED THE RELIEF VALVE (RV- 6) SERVING THE ADAMS RD., OUTLET TO ACTIVATE AND REMAIN OPEN UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 06:18.  THE RESPONDING IM PERFORMED A VALVING OPERATION TO ISOLATE THE FAILED REGULATOR ALLOWING THE STANDBY REGULATOR (S2) TO FEED. THE PRESSURE ON THE ADAMS RD. OUTLET INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM OF 318.37 PSIG AND APPROXIMATELY 4.2 MMCF OF NATURAL GAS WAS VENTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.    THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE FAILURE SUGGESTED THE INLET SCREEN ON THE ADAMS RD. OUTLET MAIN RUN REGULATOR (P2) WAS PARTIALLY DISINTEGRATED CAUSING METAL DEBRIS TO CONTAMINATE THE REGULATORS INTERNAL COMPONENTS CAUSING IT TO FAIL OPEN.    THE P2 REGULATOR WAS CLEANED OF DEBRIS AND THE INLET SCREEN AND REGULATOR DIAPHRAGM WERE REPLACED.  THE EQUIPMENT WAS TESTED AND RETURN TO SERVICE.  THE IMPACTED RELIEF VALVE WAS ALSO DISASSEMBLE AND CHECKED FOR DAMAGE AND DEBRIS WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS.    AT APPROXIMATELY 04:42 THE FOLLOWING DAY THE P2 REGULATOR EXPERIENCED ANOTHER FAILURE.  THE RELIEF VALVE OPERATED AS A RESULT OF THE EXCEEDANCE.  HOWEVER, HYDRATES ENTRAINED IN THE GAS STREAM WERE FOUND TO HAVE PRECIPITATED OUT AND FROZE IN THE RELIEF VALVE'S PILOT RESULTING IN DELAYED ACTIVATION.  THE PRESSURE ON THE ADAMS RD. OUTLET INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM OF 338 PSIG FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES BEFORE RETURNING TO A STEADY RELIEF PRESSURE BELOW 110% OF MAOP. THE RELIEF VALVE WAS CLEANED, REBUILT, INSPECTED AND RETURN TO SERVICE.  REGULATOR P2 HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM SERVICE UNTIL FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND LAB ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE AND APPROPRIATE REMEDIATION ACTIONS IDENTIFIED.  A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT DETAILING THE FAILURE THAT OCCURRED ON FEBRUARY 11TH WAS REPORTED TO PHMSA ON FEBRUARY 18, 2016 (SCRC 20160022).    A MOBILE AND WALKING SURVEY WAS PERFORMED ON APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES OF 12"" STEEL HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION PIPING (300 PSIG MAOP) OPERATING AT > 20% SMYS AND ASSOCIATED SERVICE LINES BETWEEN THE COOLIDGE CITY GATE AND MAPLE RD., TROY, MICHIGAN AND NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.    THE REGULATION EQUIPMENT (REGULATOR P2) REMOVED FROM SERVICE ON FEBRUARY 11, 2016 WAS REPLACED WITH A MOONEY FLOWGRID REGULATOR ON AUGUST 8, 2016 AND RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATIONS.    THE REGULATOR, DIAPHRAGM AND CAGE WERE EXAMINED BY CONSUMERS ENERGY LABORATORY SERVICES, IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THE DIAPHRAGM DIMENSIONS WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE DIMENSIONS OF THE CAGE, PREVENTING A SECURE FIT DURING ASSEMBLY. IN ADDITION, MEASUREMENT DATA INDICATED THE O-RING ASSEMBLED ON THE BONNET WAS NOT SUBJECT TO COMPRESSION DURING ASSEMBLY. THE INVESTIGATION WAS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHY THE DIAPHRAGM WAS OUT OF POSITION, AND NO FAILURE CAUSE WAS IDENTIFIED.

TOR FITTINGS ARE INSTALLED WITH A PLUG IN THE FITTING TO HOLD LINE PRESSURE AND THEN A CAP IS INSTALLED OVER THE PLUG.   AS THE EMPLOYEE STARTED REMOVING THE CAP, HE NOTICED PRESSURE UNDER THE CAP AND WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO RE-TIGHTEN THE CAP, IT GAVE WAY.  FULL FLOW OF GASOLINE WAS RELEASED FROM THE 2"" FITTING AS THERE WAS NO PLUG INSTALLED IN THE FITTING.   THE EMPLOYEE BACKED AWAY FROM THE RELEASE AND IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE CONTROL CENTER.  THE CONTROL CENTER SHUTDOWN THE PIPELINE.  PRODUCT FLOWED FOR APPROX. 3 MINUTES UNTIL PRESSURE WAS REDUCED ON THE PIPELINE AND THE TOR FITTING CAP WAS REINSTALLED.    THIS SECTION OF PIPE WAS NEWLY INSTALLED AS PART OF A 7 MILE REPLACEMENT PROJECT WHICH WAS TIED IN AND STARTED UP IN MARCH 2016.  FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, AND SUBSEQUENT SHUTDOWN OF THE BORGER DENVER PIPELINE, PHILLIPS 66 X-RAYED ALL THE NEW TOR FITTINGS INSTALLED WITH THE REPLACEMENT PROJECT AND FOUND 4 FITTINGS DID NOT HAVE PLUGS INSTALLED.  P66 IMPLEMENTED AN IMMEDIATE INTERIM COMPANY WIDE POLICY THAT TOR FITTING CAPS COULD NOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM THE HSE MANAGER AND PIPELINES MANAGER.  PRIOR TO RESTARTING THE PIPELINE, PHILLIPS 66 SEAL WELDED THE CAPS ON THE 4 TOR FITTINGS IDENTIFIED WITHOUT PLUGS INSTALLED.      THE INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT FOUND THE ROOT CAUSE TO BE THAT (DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE TOR FITTING), A PLUG WAS NOT INSTALLED (UNDER THE CAP) AS CALLED FOR BY PROCEDURE.  THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IDENTIFIED WAS TO MODIFY THE PROCEDURE ON THE USE OF A TOR FITTING TO INCLUDE A STEP TO VERIFY PLUG INSTALLATION ON THE FITTING BY X-RAY PRIOR TO REMOVAL OF THE CAP.

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK IN CPL'S MIDLAND STATION NEAR MIDLAND, TEXAS IN MIDLAND COUNTY, TEXAS. CPL DETERMINED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE THE 12"" INLET GATE VALVE ON TANK #2421 AND IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE LEAK. HOWEVER, 10 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WERE RELEASED, OF WHICH, NINE (9) BARRELS WERE PROMPTLY RECOVERED IN LIQUID FORM. CPL REMEDIATED THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON SITE. NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR FIRES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.    CPL REPORTED THE LEAK TO THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION, OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY AT 13:38 CST ON MARCH 12, 2021, AND WAS ISSUED INCIDENT NUMBER 2388 IN REFERENCE TO THE INCIDENT.    AT THE TIME OF THE IS WRITING, CPL IS IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS. THE RESULTING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK, PREVENTATIVE AND MITIGATIVE MEASURES (P&M), AND ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING THE VALVE WILL BE SUBMITTED VIA SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT(S).    SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL FILED ON 05/26/2021:  UPDATED PART G1-7 AND PART G1-8. DURING THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS, CPL DETERMINED THAT UNDER-DEPOSIT MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION (MIC) CAUSED THE FAILURE. THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE WATER DROP-OUT, SOLID DEPOSITS, AND AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF PARAFFIN ACCUMULATION ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK AND INLET VALVE. LOW FLOW CONDITIONS THROUGH THE INLET VALVE ALLOWED WATER, SOLIDS, AND PARAFFIN TO DEPOSIT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE VALVE BODY, AND A BACTERIA COLONY FORMED A MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION PIT. THE CORROSION RATE WITHIN THE PIT INCREASED DUE TO A GALVANIC COUPLE BETWEEN THE IRON SULFIDE DEPOSIT AND IRON MAGNETITE COMPOUNDS, VERIFIED BY LAB ANALYSIS, AND THE STEEL PIPE. THE SITE CONDITIONS WERE FURTHER EXACERBATED BY MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION WITHIN THE STABLE BIOFILM. THE PARAFFIN ACCUMULATION PREVENTED THE INCOMING OIL TREATED WITH CORROSION MITIGATION CHEMICALS FROM REACHING THE BACTERIA COLONY AND THE IRON SULFIDE AND IRON MAGNETITE DEPOSITS, THEREBY REDUCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CHEMICALS. IT MUST BE CONCLUDED THAT THIS CORROSION ON THE VALVE BODY WAS NOT RELATED TO THE CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF THE CRUDE OIL OR TO ANY UNEXPECTED CORROSIVENESS OF THE CRUDE OIL. RECORDS SHOW THAT THE CRUDE OIL WAS UNIFORMLY TREATED WITH CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS AND BIOCIDES, BUT THE AFTER INCIDENT INSPECTION AND LAB ANALYSIS PROVED THAT THE CORROSION CONTROL CHEMICALS WERE PREVENTED FROM REACHING THE BIOFILM BY A HEAVY LAYER OF WAXY PARAFFIN.

THE LEAK WAS FOUND BY A LANDOWNER AND THE DTE CREW WAS DISPATCHED AT 10:20 PM ON 6/30/2019.   DTE GAS LOWERED THE PRESSURE OF THE LINE AS OF 12:18 AM ON 7/1/2019 AND PRESSURE CONTROL PROCEDURE AND A REPAIR PLAN ARE BEING DEVELOPED.   APPROXIMATELY 5.5 FEET SECTION WAS REPLACED AND THE PIPE SECTION IS UNDERGOING A FAILURE INVESTIGATION BY A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY.    MPSC, JIM JOHNSON, WAS NOTIFIED AT  12:30 AM AND WE HAD A FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSION AT APPROXIMATELY  12:53 AM.   THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED AT 12:28 AM AND THE INCIDENT NUMBER IS 1250615.   THE LINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 7/4/2019.       KIEFNER PERFORMED AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. THE REPORT WAS DATED AUGUST 29, 2019. THE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION OF THE REPORT STATED ""THE LEAK THAT OCCURRED ON THE LOREED-LUDINGTON PIPELINE IN THE MLV 4-5 VALVE SECTION ON JUNE 30, 2019 WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY CORROSION WHICH THINNED THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS TO THE POINT THAT THE REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE STRESS INDUCED BY THE INTERNAL PRESSURE. THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE WALL WAS BY DUCTILE TEARING AND THE APPEARANCE OF A CRACK-LIKE FEATURE WAS CAUSED BY THE LOCALIZED NECKING OF THE MATERIAL JUST PRIOR TO TEARING.  AN AREA OF COATING DAMAGE AND DISBONDMENT, WHICH CAUSED CATHODIC SHIELDING OF THE PIPE MATERIAL, LIKELY ENABLED THE CORROSION TO OCCUR. THE PRESENCE OF A TWO PART FULL-ENCIRCLEMENT SWAMP WEIGHT OVER THE LEAK LOCATION LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR DISBANDED COATING TO SHIELD THE PIPE MATERIAL.  THE TYPE OF CORROSION THAT OCCURRED AT THIS LOCATION CAN BE DESCRIBED AS 'UNDER DEPOSIT ACID ATTACK.' HOWEVER, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE CORROSION WAS NOT IDENTIFIED. AN ANALYSIS OF THE CORROSION PRODUCTS FOR THE PRESENCE OF BACTERIA FOUND A LOW PRESENCE OF COMMON BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH PIPELINE CORROSION.

JAMES YOUNG, BRUCE BURGESS, BUSTER FELTON, AND MARIO BYRD PERFORMED THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AT KEITH-A-QUE, WHICH IS LOCATED AT 249 EAST WASHINGTON AVE. DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION GAS PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. ASHBURN GAS SUPERINTENDENT ROGER GIDDENS REPORTED TO THEIR LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00AM TO HELP DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. DURING THE INVESTIGATION OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT TOWN REPORTED HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS. PROPANE ODOR WAS DETERMINED TO BE PRESENT WITHIN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM.   AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00PM CITY PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT PROPANE WAS BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM FROM FOUR 500 GALLON PROPANE TANKS CONNECTED TO A FUEL LINE AT THE HAT CREEK PEANUT COMPANY INC. LOCATED AT 465 BUSSEY ROAD, SYCAMORE GA. 31790.  LATER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THIS METERED SERVICE WAS DELIVERING LINE PRESSURE TO THE HAT CREEK PER AGREEMENT BETWEEN ASHBURN AND HAT CREEK.  HAT CREEK CONNECTED THE PROPANE TANKS TO ITS INTERNAL PIPING IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPLEMENT ITS NATURAL GAS SUPPLY DURING HIGH DEMAND PERIODS.  THE ABSENCE OF A SERVICE REGULATOR AT THE METER ALLOWED THE HIGHER-PRESSURE PROPANE TO FLOW BACKWARD THROUGH THE METER INTO ASHBURN'S NATURAL GAS FACILITIES.  GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (GPSC) INSPECTORS JOSH LAIRSEY AND ROB PACER WERE NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45PM ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2010.   ASHBURN CITY MANAGER BEN TAYLOR ESTABLISHED A COMMAND CENTER AT CITY HALL TO DEVELOP A PLAN OF ACTION WITH ALL CITY PERSONNEL. DUE TO THE UNKNOWN VOLUME AND EXTENT OF PROPANE IN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM, CITY PERSONNEL DECIDED TO BEGIN SHUTTING OFF ALL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. MUTUAL ASSISTANCE WAS REQUESTED FROM AND PROVIDED BY THE CITIES OF DOUGLAS, TIFTON, CORDELE, SYLVESTER AND FITZGERALD.  ASHBURN CONFIRMED THAT THESE CITIES' PERSONNEL HAVE APPROPRIATE OPERATOR QUALIFICATIONS TO PERFORM THE REQUESTED TASK. THE SHUT OFF PROCESS BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00PM ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24TH, 2010.  ACTING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM GPSC TO REPORT THIS EVENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AS AN INCIDENT PURSUANT TO 49 CFR PART 191, BEN TAYLOR REQUESTED THAT THE SUBSCRIBED REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SERVICE (SRCS) MAKE THE TELEPHONIC REPORT ON BEHALF OF ASHBURN.   ON 9/24/2010 AT 3:16PM, SRCS MANAGER BILL DEFOOR CALLED THE NRC AND GAVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO ASSIGNED CASE #955047 TO THE REPORT.ON 9/24/2010 AT 6:59PM THE VALVE SUPPLYING NATURAL GAS TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS SHUT OFF.  THE SHUTTING OFF AND LOCKING OF ALL SERVICES WAS COMPLETE AT APPROXIMATELY 3:15AM ON 9/25/2010. DURING THE COMPLETION OF THE SHUT-OFF ACTION LINE PRESSURE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DROPPED TO ZERO AS HAT CREEK CONSUMED THE REMAINING CONTAMINATED GAS THROUGH ITS PEANUT DRYERS. ON 9/25/2010 AT 9:00AM THE VALVE CONTROLLING THE GAS FLOW TO THE CITY WAS CUT BACK ON. AS A PRECAUTION, LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WERE MONITORED FOR 100% GAS USING (CGI) COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS. THE LOCATIONS THAT WERE MONITORED WERE INDUSTRIAL BLVD., CENTRAL PACKING PLANT, AND BRIDGES ROAD. WHEN 100% LEVELS WERE CONFIRMED, CREWS BEGAN CUTTING ON SERVICES AND RELIGHTING APPLIANCES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.  THE RELIGHTING PROCESS STARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM SATURDAY MORNING.

(SNG) GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE PUBLIC REGARDING A LOUD NOISE COMING FROM A PIPELINE FACILITY. A SNG TECHNICIAN WAS CALLED OUT TO THE SITE AND ARRIVED AT 3:45 AM. UPON ARRIVAL THE TECHNICIAN MET WITH EMERGENCY RESPONDER PERSONNEL WHO PROCEEDED TO BLOCK THE ACCESS ROAD TO THE COMPRESSOR STATION. THE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE EMERGENCY BLOWDOWN VALVE AND WAS UNABLE TO, SO THE DECISION WAS MADE TO ESD THE STATION, THUS ENDING THE GAS RELEASE.   AN ERL (EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE) CONFERENCE CALL WAS HELD AT 4:10 AM ABOUT THE EVENT. ON THE CALL IT WAS FORECASTED THAT THE GAS LOSS FROM THE EVENT WOULD EXCEED THE REPORTABLE THRESHOLD OF 3,000 MCF. AT THIS TIME (4:10 AM) SNG HAD CONFIRMED DISCOVERY OF THE INCIDENT.   THE PILOT IN THE EMERGENCY BLOWDOWN VALVE WAS REPLACED.   AFTER INVESTIGATING, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PILOT ACTUATOR OF THE EMERGENCY BLOWDOWN VALVE HAD A LEAKING SEAL ON THE POWER GAS SIDE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ESCAPING GAS FROM THE SEAL MADE ITS WAY TO THE VENT WHERE IT FROZE OVER THE EXHAUST PORT, PREVENTING THE LEAKING GAS FROM REACHING ATMOSPHERE. THE PRESSURE FROM THE LEAKING GAS CONTINUED TO BUILD, AND UPON REACHING 150 PSI THE VALVE OPERATOR ACTIVATED TO ITS ""SAFE STATE"" AS IT IS DESIGNED TO DO, AND IN THIS CONFIGURATION THE SAFE STATE HAS THE VALVE IN THE OPEN POSITION. THE VALVE OPERATOR'S SAFE STATE CONFIGURATION RESULTED IN THE EMERGENCY BLOWDOWN VALVE OPENING WITHOUT SNG'S COMMAND.   BEFORE THE EVENT, SNG HAD IDENTIFIED THE VALVE OPERATOR AS LEAKING AND MADE PLANS TO ADDRESS THE LEAK, BUT DUE TO NOT BEING AWARE OF THIS OPERATOR'S FAIL SAFE MODE AN INCORRECT ASSESSMENT OF THE TIMEFRAME FOR REPAIR WAS MADE.

A HIGH DISCHARGE PRESSURE ALARM OF 1401 PSIG WITH A SET POINT OF 1340 PSIG WAS ISSUED FROM SCADA TO THE TERMINAL OPERATORS. AT 20:32, THE CHOCTAW ETHYLENE PUMPS SHUT DOWN DUE TO THE HIGH DISCHARGE PRESSURE. AT 20:33, A GAS DETECTOR ISSUED AN ALARM TO SCADA. TERMINAL OPERATORS VISUALLY VERIFIED A GAS LEAK IN THE ETHYLENE HEADER AREA AT 20:33. SET POINTS FOR THE GAS DETECTOR ARE 20% ALARM AND 40% FOR SHUTDOWN OF SYSTEMS. AT 20:34, THE TERMINAL OPERATOR ENGAGED THE PLANT ESD BUTTON WHICH SHUT DOWN ALL PLANT OPERATIONS.    ON 2/16/2021, BASED ON FIELD FINDINGS, EVENT MONITORING, AND SCADA DATA, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ETHYLENE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY AN INADEQUATE TUBING CONNECTION. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT A VALVE OPENED WITHOUT A SCADA COMMAND DUE TO FREEZING WATER IN THE SOLENOID THAT ALLOWED AIR TO ENTER THE PNEUMATIC ACTUATOR. WATER ENTERED THE SOLENOID DUE TO A MISSING WEATHER/BUG CAP. THE WATER FROZE IN THE SOLENOID DUE TO EXTREME COLD TEMPERATURES THAT WERE BELOW FREEZING FOR SEVERAL DAYS. ICE PLUGGED THE EXIT VENT ON THE SOLENOID AND PREVENTED THE VALVE FROM CLOSING AND ALLOWED THE VALVE TO REMAIN OPEN. THE WELL 24 INJECTION PUMP DID NOT SHUT OFF DUE TO A MISSING PERMISSIVE LOGIC IN THE PLC PROGRAMMING AND CREATED THE HIGH-PRESSURE EVENT IN THE ETHYLENE HEADER PIPING SYSTEM. WHILE WELL 24, WHICH HAS AN MOP OF 1440 PSI, REACHED 1528 PSI, A LINE BREAK PREVENTED THE ETHYLENE HEADER FROM REACHING THIS HIGH PRESSURE.    SCADA LOGIC WAS UPDATED TO PREVENT RECURRENCE. THE SETPOINT FOR SHUTDOWN WAS LOWERED. REPAIR OF THE VALVE TUBING INCLUDED REMOVAL OF THE OLD TUBE FITTING AND REPLACEMENT WITH NEW STAINLESS FITTINGS AND TUBING. THE SOLENOID WAS REPLACED WITH A SOLENOID WITH A CAP THAT KEEPS THE PORT OF THE SOLENOID FREE FROM PLUGGING SO AIR CAN ESCAPE DURING OPERATION OF THE SOLENOID.     3/9/2021 REVISED TO CORRECT TIME OF INITIAL NOTIFICATION TO NRC.",11458.046793760832,0.0,1440.0,97.29166666666669,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.98,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE COMPANY-CONTROLLED ACCESS TO THE ROWS ON EACH SIDE OF THE PECOS RIVER AND STARTED WORK TO DETERMINE WHICH LINE WAS LEAKING.  THE COMPANY BLEW EACH LINE DOWN TO DETERMINE WHICH LINE WAS THE LEAKING LINE. THE ORDER THE COMPANY BLEW THE PIPELINES DOWN WAS THE 10"" GAS GATHERING, 8"" GAS TRANSMISSION, 6"" NGL AND THEN THE 8"" NGL LOOP TO LONE STAR.  THE SECTION OF BORE PIPE THAT LEAKED HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BORE AND SEVERAL PIPE SPECIMENS, INCLUDING THE WELD THAT HAD THE HOLE, HAVE BEEN SENT TO A METALLURGY LAB FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS.  A NEW BORE WAS DRILLED, AND THE NEW SEGMENT OF PIPE WAS INSTALLED AND PUT INTO SERVICE. ILI TOOLS HAVE BEEN RUN ON THE ENTIRE 8"" NGL LOOP TO LONE STAR AND THE COMPANY EXPEDITED THE DATA RESULTS AND SHOULD HAVE RESULTS 45 TO 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE SUCCESSFUL ILI TOOL RUN ON 11/18/2021. THE ILI TOOL RUN REQUIRED NO IMMEDIATE REPAIRS, THERE IS ONE DENT AND ONE CORROSION SPOT WE ARE INVESTIGATING, AND RE-INSPECTION HAS BEEN SET TO THE MAXIMUM 5 YEARS ACCORDING TO TRRC SECTION 8.101(A)(2).    THE ELEMENT MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY FINAL REPORT INDICATED FAILURE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF CREVICE AND GENERAL CORROSION THAT OCCURRED ON AND NEAR GIRTH WELDS AND HEAT AFFECTED ZONES. THE CORROSION HAD CREATED A THROUGH-WALL PENETRATION THAT RESULTED IN THE PIPE LEAKAGE.     TO ESTIMATE THE LEAKED QUANTITY, WE ARE ASSUMING THAT THE LEAK BEGAN ON 10/16/21.  THE AERIAL PIPELINE PATROL REPORT COMPLETED ON 10/15/21 STATES THAT NO LEAKS WERE OBSERVED, WE BELIEVE IT IS CONSERVATIVE TO ASSUME THE LEAK STARTED THE NEXT DAY.  THE LEAK WAS STOPPED ON THE EVENING OF 10/28/21 THUS 13 DAYS.  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE OBSERVED LEAK QUANTITIES ALONG WITH THE TYPE OF FAILURE OBSERVED (NOT A RUPTURE) WE BELIEVE A 0.5 CM DIAMETER HOLE IS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE (THE HOLE OBSERVED, AND MEASURED POST REMOVAL SUPPORTS THIS ANALYSIS.)  A 0.5 CM HOLE WITH 1100PSI DIFFERENTIAL WILL FLOW APPROXIMATELY 650 BBL/D ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATION WHICH MEANS A TOTAL LEAKED VOLUME OF 8450BBLS.  OF WORTH NOTING IS THE LEAKED FLUID IS A NGL WHICH IS A HIGHLY VOLATILE LIQUID, ENGINEERING ANALYSIS VIA OUR PROCESS SIMULATION INDICATES THAT COMPOSITION OF THE NGL FLASHES 100% TO VAPOR AT THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURES AS LONG AS TEMPERATURES REMAIN ABOVE 35F.

RECEIVED AN ESD SAFETY STATUS ALARM FOR THE FUEL METER AT EPPS STATION THAT THE CONTROLLER ACKNOWLEDGED IMMEDIATELY. THE COMMUNICATIONS AT EPPS STATION WENT DOWN THE SAME TIME AS THE ESD TRIPPED. GAS CONTROL COULD NOT SEE A PROBLEM UNTIL THERE WAS A PRESSURE DROP AT THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM LOCATIONS. COMMUNICATIONS WERE OUT AT THE STATION SO THE CONTROLLERS WERE NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM AN ACTUAL ESD. CONTROLLERS REVIEWED UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PRESSURES AND THERE WERE NO NEGATIVE RATE OF CHANGE ALARMS PRESENT. UPSTREAM PRESSURE STARTED TO SHOW A SLOW DECLINE IN PRESSURE.

THE BRANCH CONNECTION HAD BEEN BLINDED OFF SOME TIME AGO AND WAS NO LONGER IN SERVICE.  SINCE THE BRANCH WAS NO LONGER NEEDED, THE NEW SPOOL WAS BUILT WITHOUT THE 2"" BRANCH CONNECTION.    WHEN THE PIN HOLE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED, IT WAS IMMEDIATELY REPAIRED WITH A  CLAMP, WHICH COST LESS THAN $50,000.  ONCE THE OPS FACILITY ENGINEER WAS INFORMED ON 9/16/2014 @ 13:54 AND HE INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE LEAK AND REPAIR.  THE FACILITY ENGINEER & OPERATIONS TEAM ANALYZED THE SITUATION AND DECIDED THE CLAMP WAS NOT SUFFICIENT ON 9/17/2014 @ 12:30.    DUE TO THE FACT THE BRANCH CONNECTION WAS NO LONGER NEEDED THE TEAM DETERMINED THE PIPING SPOOL SHOULD BE REPLACED TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK.  SINCE THE COST TO REPAIR THE LEAK WAS NOW GOING TO EXCEED $50,000, THE OPERATOR REPORTED THE LEAK TO NRC ON 9/17/2014 @ 13:36.  THE REPLACING OF THE SPOOL ACTUALLY COST $96,000.

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK FROM STATION PIPING WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF CPL'S ECTOR COUNTY STATION.  APPROXIMATELY THREE (3) BARRELS OF OIL WERE RELEASED, ALL OF WHICH WERE RECOVERED EITHER IN LIQUID FORM OR FROM SOIL REMEDIATION.  ALL REMEDIATION IS COMPLETE AND ALL PRODUCT IS REMOVED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.    SUBSEQUENT TO A VISUAL INSPECTION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT INTERNAL CORROSION WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK.

AN INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING TO DETERMINE IF MICROBIOLOGICALLY-INDUCED CORROSION (MIC) MAY ALSO BE A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE.  IF SO, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED AND THE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO PREVENT FUTURE SIMILAR INCIDENTS FROM OCCURRING.    SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT FILED ON APRIL 16, 2020:  SINCE THE ORIGINAL REPORT WAS FILED ON MARCH 09, 2020, CPL HAS CONDUCTED A ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS AND CONFIRMED THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY INTERNAL CORROSION. THIS INTERNAL CORROSION WAS CONSISTENT WITH MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION (MIC). THE FAILED PIPELINE HAD, DUE TO CHANGES IN FLOW CONDITIONS DICTATED BY MARKET FORCES, EXPERIENCED A PERIOD OF FLOW STAGNATION WHICH PERMITTED WATER TO SEPARATE FROM THE CRUDE OIL PRODUCT. THIS SEPARATION RESULTED IN FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR MIC TO FORM.    AN UNRELATED EXPANSION PROJECT, TO BE CONSTRUCTED SOON, WILL RECONFIGURE THE STATION PIPING.

TECH CON HAD FAILED TO (1) SEND PROPER ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION; (2) ACCURATELY IDENTIFY OR WHITE LINE THE AREA OF EXCAVATION; OR (3) NOTIFY HOLLY ENERGY PRIOR TO EXCAVATING AND/OR EXPOSING (POT-HOLING) THE PIPELINE SO THAT HOLLY ENERGY COULD RE-MARK THE PIPELINE AND WITNESS THIS EXCAVATION PROCESS AS REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH TEXAS UTILITY CODE SUBCHAPTER D SEC. 251.151(C).      TECH CON TRENCHING NEVER NOTIFIED HOLLY ENERGY OF ITS INTENT TO EXCAVATE ACROSS HOLLY ENERGY'S PIPELINE. HOLLY ENERGY RECEIVED A ONE-CALL NOTICE FROM JD KING ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 6. HOLLY ENERGY DOES NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN TECH CON TRENCHING AND JD KING, BUT BOTH ENTITIES APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT FOR WHICH TECH CON TRENCHING WAS CONDUCTING TRENCHING ON JUNE 13.  ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 7, JOHN OSBORNE OF HOLLY ENERGY CALLED RICKY KNELSEN OF JD KING AT THE NUMBER IDENTIFIED ON THE ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION TICKET BUT RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 10 (JUNE 8 AND 9 WERE WEEKEND DAYS), OSBORNE REACHED KNELSEN BY TELEPHONE TO REQUEST A DESCRIPTION OF WHERE JD KING PLANNED TO EXCAVATE. THE ONE-CALL TICKET DID NOT PROVIDE A CLEAR IDENTIFICATION OF THE AREA, AND NEITHER JD KING (NOR TECH CON TRENCHING) HAD MARKED THE PROPOSED EXCAVATION AREA WITH WHITE LINES.     AFTER OSBORNE EXPLAINED THE LOCATION OF HOLLY ENERGY'S PIPELINE, KNELSEN TOLD OSBORNE THAT JD KING WOULD NOT START EXCAVATING IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPELINE UNTIL THE WEEK OF JUNE 17. OSBORNE AND KNELSEN AGREED THAT THE TWO WOULD MEET AT THE SITE AT THIS TIME SO THAT KNELSEN COULD IDENTIFY WHERE THE EXCAVATION WOULD CROSS THE PIPELINE AND OSBORNE WOULD MARK THE PIPELINE IN ADVANCE OF TRENCHING ACTIVITIES. KNELSEN SAID THAT HE WOULD CALL OSBORNE WHEN THE EXCAVATION WAS CLOSER TO THE PIPELINE TO ARRANGE THE MEETING SPECIFICS. OSBORNE ALSO TOLD KNELSEN THAT HOLLY ENERGY WISHED TO BE PRESENT DURING EXCAVATION SO THAT OSBORNE COULD VISUALLY OBSERVE POT-HOLES CORED ADJACENT TO THE PIPELINE AND TO ENSURE THAT EXCAVATION BELOW HOLLY ENERGY'S PIPELINE WAS PERFORMED SAFELY.     AS INDICATED ABOVE, KNELSEN TOLD OSBORNE THAT JD KING WOULD NOT ARRIVE TO THE PIPELINE AREA UNTIL THE WEEK OF JUNE 17. BUT, THE EXCAVATORS MOVED INTO THE AREA MUCH SOONER THAN OSBORNE HAD BEEN TOLD, AND NEITHER KNELSEN NOR ANYONE ELSE WITH JD KING CALLED OSBORNE TO INFORM HIM OF THIS FACT. ON JUNE 12, EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT HIT HOLLY ENERGY'S PIPELINE, CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE AND THE RELEASE OF PRODUCT TO THE ENVIRONMENT.     IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT, AS A RESULT OF A PRIOR ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION, HOLLY ENERGY'S PIPELINE WAS ALREADY MARKED IN THE AREA WHERE THE TRENCHING EQUIPMENT HIT THE PIPELINE WITH YELLOW PIN FLAGS.

THE LINE WAS SHUT DOWN AT 1551 IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE AND CONDUCT SEVERAL STATIC PRESSURE TESTS. AT 1920 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A SECTION OF THE LINE BETWEEN CONCORD STATION AND THE HILLGRADE BLOCK VALVE WAS UNABLE TO HOLD ADEQUATE PRESSURE, AND A THREATENED RELEASE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO OES/NRC. THE LINE WAS PATROLLED DURING THIS TIME BY GROUND-BASED RIGHT-OF-WAY PATROLS WHICH COULD NOT FIND ANY INDICATION OF A RELEASE BETWEEN CONCORD AND THE HILLGRADE BLOCK VALVE. THE GROUND PATROL ALSO INCLUDED SNIFFING AT KNOWN STOPPLE LOCATIONS FOR THE PRESENCE OF PETROLEUM VAPORS. WITH NO PHYSICAL INDICATIONS OF A RELEASE OR ANY PETROLEUM ODORS/VAPORS OBSERVED ALONG THE RIGHT-OF-WAY, THE INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS POINTED TO PRESSURE BLEEDING BACK INTO CONCORD STATION AND PRODUCT TEMPERATURE CHANGES AS THE SOURCE OF THE PRESSURE DROP BETWEEN CONCORD STATION AND THE HILLGRADE BLOCK VALVE. ON THE MORNING OF 11/23, AN ADDITIONAL TEST WAS CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM PRODUCT TEMPERATURE CHANGES AS THE SOURCE OF THE PRESSURE DROP IN THE LINE. THIS CONFIRMATION TEST FAILED.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE LINE WAS PURGED WITH NITROGEN AND A TRACER GAS AT 1500 ON 11/24 IN AN ATTEMPT TO PINPOINT ANY WOULD-BE LEAK LOCATION. THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED AT 2203 BY GROUND PATROLS, AND CREWS ARRIVED AND BEGAN EXCAVATING THE LINE WHERE THE RELEASE WAS DISCOVERED. RELEASE CONFIRMATION WAS MADE TO OES/NRC AT THIS TIME. UPON EXCAVATION, A 5.5 INCH CRACK IN THE LINE WAS DISCOVERED AND THE LINE SECTION WAS CUT OUT AND SHIPPED TO A METALLURGICAL LAB FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. A REPLACEMENT SECTION WAS WELDED INTO PLACE ON 11/25 AND THE LINE WAS REFILLED AND PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON THE MORNING OF 11/26. THE OFFICIAL CAUSE OF WHAT CAUSED THE CRACK WILL BE PENDING AFTER FURTHER METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.

THE FLOW RATE FROM THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE EXCEEDED THE SUMP CAPACITY CAUSING IT TO OVERFLOW.  AN ALARM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUMP FAILED TO ACTIVATE.       THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE WAS REPLACED AND RE-PIPED TO RELIEVE INTO A STORAGE TANK RATHER THAN A SUMP.  THE FAILURES RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:    AS DESCRIBED IN THE INITIAL REPORT, THIS INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF A THERMAL RELIEF VALVE TO RE-SEAT AFTER ACTIVATING.  THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE IS INSTALLED BETWEEN A PUMP DISCHARGE AND BACK PRESSURE CONTROL VALVE.  THE CONTROL VALVE WAS ORIGINALLY AIR OPERATED.  DUE TO EXCESSIVE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, THE OLD CONTROL VALVE WAS REPLACED BY A NEW, ELECTRIC MOTOR OPERATED VALVE.   WHEN THE ELECTRIC OPERATED VALVE WAS INSTALLED, THE ELECTRONIC TECHNICIAN SET THE VALVE TO CLOSE COMPLETELY WHEN THE PIPELINE PUMP WAS STOPPED.  THE AIR OPERATED CONTROL VALVE DID NOT CLOSE COMPLETELY WHEN THE PIPELINE PUMP WAS STOPPED. THUS, AFTER THE ELECTRIC OPERATED CONTROL VALVE WAS INSTALLED, THE PUMP WAS STARTING AGAINST A SHUT VALVE.  THIS REDUCED THE STARTING CURRENT IN THE PUMP MOTOR BUT ALSO CAUSED THE PRESSURE IN THE LINE BETWEEN THE PUMP AND VALVE TO RISE TO A LEVEL THAT CAUSED THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE TO ACTIVATE UNTIL THE CONTROL VALVE OPENED ENOUGH TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO ALLOW THE THERMAL RELIEF TO RE-SEAT.   THE RELIEF VALVE SETTING IS 550 PSIG, THE MOP OF THE LINE IS 800 PSIG AND THE PUMP SHUTOFF HEAD IS 620 PSIG.  THIS STARTUP PROCEDURE WAS OCCURRING FOR SOME TIME PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  THE REPEATED ACTIVATION OF THE RELIEF VALVE DURING SYSTEM STARTUP COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IT NOT RE-SEATING.    THE FLOW RATE FROM THE THERMAL RELIEF NOT RE-SEATING EXCEEDED THE CAPACITY OF THE SMALL SUMP PUMP.  THIS RESULTED IN A CONTINUALLY RISING LEVEL IN THE SUMP WHICH ULTIMATELY OVERFLOWED, CAUSING THE RELEASE.  ALTHOUGH EQUIPPED WITH A HIGH SUMP LEVEL ALARM, THE ALARM FAILED TO ALERT THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR BECAUSE THE ALARM FLOAT BECAME STUCK CAUSING THE ALARM SWITCH NOT TO ACTIVATE.      AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT, SEVERAL ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT:    -A REVIEW OF THE STARTUP PROTOCOL FOR THIS SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED.  AS A RESULT THE CONTROL VALVE SETTING WAS CHANGED SO THAT THE VALVE DID NOT SHUT COMPLETELY WHEN THE PUMP IS SHUTDOWN.  THIS IS ALLOWING FLOW THROUGH THE VALVE UPON STARTUP AND MAINTAINING THE PRESSURE UPSTREAM OF THE VALVE BELOW THE SETTING OF THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE;  -A ""EXCESSIVE RUN TIME"" ALARM FEATURE WAS INSTALLED ON THE SUMP PUMP TO ALERT THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR WHEN THE SUMP PUMP IS RUNNING LONGER THAN - NORMAL; AND   -A NEW THERMAL RELIEF VALVE WAS INSTALLED AND ITS DISCHARGE RE-PIPED TO RELIEF INTO A STORAGE TANK RATHER THAN THE SMALL SUMP.",287.0,0.0,800.0,68.75,1.0,0.0,0.0,21.75,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ON OCTOBER 17, 2018 GSPP INITIATED LINE FILL ON OUR 4"" HENNESSEY PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM A TRUCK INJECTION  STATION NEAR HENNESSEY OKLAHOMA TO AN INTERCONNECT ON THE GSPP 8"" MAINLINE NEAR COVINGTON OK. GSPP  PERSONNEL SHUTDOWN AT 5PM. FLOW WAS REINITIATED AT 8:00AM ON 10/18/18 TO FINISH THE LINE FILL. ON  OCTOBER 19, 2018, AT 6:15 PM, WE RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM ORR CONSTRUCTION THAT OUR 4 INCH PIPELINE  WAS LEAKING. THE CONTROL ROOM WAS NOTIFIED AND THE PIPELINE PUMPS AT OUR HENNESSEY TRUCK STATION  WERE SHUT DOWN. FIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE THEN CALLED OUT TO ISOLATE THE SECTION OF THE LINE THAT  WAS LEAKING AND BEGIN TO ASSESS THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE. THE LINE WAS ISOLATED WITHIN 1-HOUR OF INITIAL  NOTIFICATION. A TEMPORARY CLAMP WAS INSTALLED OVER THE LEAKING SEGMENT OF PIPE. INITIAL REMEDIATION  EFFORTS FOCUSED ON EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATED WATER AND SOIL AND CONTAINMENT THROUGH USE OF  TEMPORARY BERMS AND INSTALLATION OF EARTHEN DAMS. ON OCTOBER 20, 2018 SOIL AND WATER REMEDIATION  EFFORTS COMMENCED IN EARNEST. CONCURRENTLY WITH REMEDIATION EFFORTS, THE DAMAGED PORTION OF THE LINE  WAS REPLACED. AN INLINE INSPECTION WAS CONDUCTED ON THE LINE TO ENSURE THAT NO ADDITIONAL DAMAGE  OCCURRED, AND THE LINE WAS RE-HYDRO TESTED TO ESTABLISH MAOP. AS OF NOVEMBER 8, 2018 REMEDIATION  EFFORTS ARE ONGOING AND THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN RETURNED TO SERVICE. GREAT SALT PLAINS MIDSTREAM IS  CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND THE OKLAHOMA CORPORATION COMMISSION THROUGH  THE REMEDIATION PROCESS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 1,562 BBLS HAVE BEEN LOST AND APPROXIMATELY 1,300 BBLS  HAVE BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE SOIL. 320 BBLS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED AND RETURNED TO GSPM PIPELINES.  A CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE PIPELINE SEGMENT THAT HAS BEEN PLACED WE BELIEVE THE LEAK IS THE RESULT OF AN  UNREPORTED LINE STRIKE WHICH HAD TO OF OCCURRED BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE OPERATIONAL HYDRO TEST TO VERIFY  LINE INTEGRITY AND THE INTRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL INTO THE PIPELINE. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO  PROVE WHO STRUCK THE PIPELINE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE. WE REVIEWED THE ONE CALL ACTIVITY FOR  THE AREA OF THE LEAK. ALL TICKETS WERE MARKED PROPERLY.  WE FEEL THAT THE CGA ROOT CAUSE IS ""EXCAVATION PRACTICES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT"" DUE TO THE FACT THE LINE WAS  STRUCK WITHOUT PROPER ONE CALL NOTIFICATION AND POST DAMAGE OPERATOR NOTIFICATION.  REPAIR AND REMEDIATION COSTS INCURRED AT THIS TIME ARE STILL BEING ACCOUNTED, BUT CURRENTLY IS LESS THAN  $1MM.

ZIA PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE BUILDING AT 641 SUDDERTH DR. WAS VACANT.  ZIA PERSONNEL EXCAVATED THE MAIN ON EACH SIDE OF THE DAMAGE TO SQUEEZE OFF THE LINE AND SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF GAS.   BETWEEN 9:45AM AND 9:55AM, ZIA PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO EXCAVATE THE MAIN ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE DAMAGE AND INSTALL SQUEEZE OFF EQUIPMENT.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:55AM, ZIA PERSONNEL REQUESTED A MECHANICAL EXCAVATOR TO ASSIST WITH EXCAVATING THE MAIN ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE DAMAGE DUE TO MULTIPLE LAYER OF ASPHALT AND GRAVEL.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:41AM, ZIA PERSONNEL REQUESTED TRAFFIC CONTROL ASSISTANCE FROM LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHICH ARRIVED AT 10:45AM.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:05AM, AN EXPLOSION AT 641 SUDDERTH DR OCCURRED.  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION, THE AREA WAS EVACUATED.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:20AM, THE MAIN WAS MECHANICALLY SQUEEZED SHUT AND THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED.  POST-INCIDENT, ZIA PERSONNEL PERFORMED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE AREA AND CHECKED SYSTEM PRESSURE TO VERIFY NO ADDITIONAL ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS.  THE DAMAGE TO THE GAS MAIN WAS REPAIRED ON DECEMBER 28, 2017 AND FLOW WAS RE-ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE MAIN.    AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EXCAVATION DAMAGE REVEALED THAT THE MOST RECENT LINE LOCATE TICKET, 17NV270924, HAD EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 13, 2017.  THE MARKS WERE STILL VISIBLE ON THE GROUND AND WERE ACCURATE.  PNM HAD EXPOSED AN ABANDONED STEEL LINE WITH YELLOW COATING APPROXIMATELY 12' AWAY FROM THE ACTIVE 2' PE GAS LINE.

THE TECHNICIAN AND LEAD OPERATOR REVIEWED THE TRAP PROCEDURE, AND THEN TOGETHER PRESSURED UP THE INCOMING AND RECEIVING TRAPS.  THE ONE INCH VENT VALVE ON THE RECEIVING TRAP WAS INADVERTENTLY LEFT IN THE OPEN POSITION.  THE LEAD OPERATOR AND TECHNICIAN WENT INSIDE OF BUILDING TO OPEN TRAP VALVES TO RECEIVE FLOW FOR PIG TO ARRIVE.  BECAUSE OF THE FREEZING WEATHER, THEY DECIDED TO USE THE LUI PANEL INSIDE THE BUILDING TO OPEN TRAP VALVES.  WHEN THE INLET AND OUTLET TRAP VALVES WERE OPENED THE PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE WAS APPROXIMATELY 250PSI.  THE PRESSURE WAS IMMEDIATLY RELEASED ON THE DRAIN LINE THROUGH THE VENTED VALVE THAT WAS INADVERTENTLY LEFT OPEN. THE SIGHT GLASS SHATTERED, CAUSING 61-GRADE OIL TO SPRAY ON THE DRAIN SLAB AND ON THE GROUND AROUND THE TRAP.  THE LEAD OPERATOR THEN INSTRUCTED TECHNICIAN TO CLOSE TRAP VALVES.  THE TRAP VALVES ARE 45 SEC OPERATORS SO IT TOOK THAT LONG FOR VALVES TO CLOSE.  BY THE TIME THE VALVES WENT CLOSED APPROXIMATELY 362 GALLONS HAD BEEN RELEASED ON SLAB AND SURROUNDING AREA.

AT 4:00 PM ON JANUARY 15, 2016, AN OPERATOR PERFORMED A SITE INSPECTION AND NO LEAK WAS OBSERVED. AT 5:30 PM A SMALL VAPOR CLOUD WAS NOTICED BY PLANT EMPLOYEES. THE FLOW TO THE METER SKID WAS STOPPED AND A CALL TO THE OPERATOR WAS MADE. THE OPERATOR RETURNED TO THE SITE AND ISOLATED THE TUBING AND REPAIRED THE DAMAGED PIECE. NORMAL OPERATIONS RESUMED AT 9:45 PM.     CAUSES:    - THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS A RUPTURE IN A 1/4"" SCHEDULE 10, TYPE 316L, STAINLESS STEEL TUBE DESIGNED TO RELIEVE PRODUCT PRESSURE FROM A THERMAL RELIEF VALVE.   - THE LOCAL TEMPERATURE DURING THE DAY OF THE RUPTURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES F.     THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION:    - A 1/2' ROOT VALVE DESIGNED TO BE OPEN DURING NORMAL OPERATION WAS NEARLY CLOSED, NOT ALLOWING WATER TO DRAIN FROM THE TUBING LEG.   - THE SPLIT IN THE TUBING WAS DUE TO WATER FREEZING INSIDE THE TUBE CAUSING DUCTILE TEARING FROM INTERNAL PRESSURE GENERATED FROM THE EXPANSION OF WATER FREEZING INTO ICE.   - WATER WAS MOST LIKELY INTRODUCED FROM A METER PROVER CONNECTION.   - A WATER DRAW TEST WAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED ON THE PROVER AND RESIDUAL AMOUNTS OF WATER WERE NOT REMOVED.   - THE 1/2"" ROOT VALVE CONNECTING TO THE THERMAL RELIEF WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL DEVICE THAT SHOULD BE LEFT OPEN DURING NORMAL OPERATION.    CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:     - THE WATER DRAW PROCEDURE WILL BE REVISED WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONTRACTOR TO DRY THE PROVER LOOP AFTER THE WATER DRAW.   - OPERATIONS WILL VERIFY NO FREE LIQUIDS ARE IN THE PROVER PRIOR TO INSTALLATION AFTER THE WATER DRAW TEST.  THERMAL RELIEF VALVES AND CONNECTING ROOT VALVES WILL BE ADDED TO CRITICAL DEVICE LIST AT ALL METER AND BOOSTER STATIONS TO ENSURE THE ROOT VALVE IS OPEN DURING NORMAL OPERATION.",3301.0,0.0,1440.0,47.22222222222222,1.0,0.0,0.0,-8.350000000000001,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ON OCTOBER 13, 2018 THE INITIAL PRESSURE TEST WAS STOPPED DUE TO PRESSURE LOSS.  AFTER PATROLLING THE TEST SEGMENT A PINHOLE FROM AN EXTERNAL CORROSION ANOMALY WAS DISCOVERED AT MP 25.1 ON OCTOBER 15, 2018.  THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND A PLIDCO CLAMP WAS INSTALLED OVER THE PINHOLE.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF RESIDUAL PRODUCT WAS DISCOVERED AT THIS TIME.  THE EXCAVATION WAS LEFT OPEN FOR MONITORING OF THE CLAMP DURING SUBSEQUENT HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TESTING ACTIVITIES.      DURING SUBSEQUENT PRESSURE TEST ACTIVITIES CREWS CONTINUED TO MONITOR THIS LOCATION AND PATROL THE REMAINDER OF THE TEST SEGMENT.  THE AREA WAS EXPERIENCING HEAVY RAINFALL DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AND A VACUUM TRUCK WAS ROUTINELY REMOVING RAIN WATER FROM THE OPEN EXCAVATION WHERE THE CLAMP WAS APPLIED.  FOR SAFETY REASONS PERSONNEL WERE NOT PERMITTED TO BE IN THE EXCAVATION DURING THE SUBSEQUENT PRESSURE TEST ATTEMPTS SO THE CLAMP WAS MONITORED FOR LEAKAGE FROM THE TOP OF THE EXCAVATION TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE.  THIS CIRCUMSTANCE COMBINED WITH THE CONSTANT COLLECTION OF RAINWATER IN THE EXCAVATION MASKED THE ESCAPE OF DYED HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TEST WATER AND RESIDUAL PRODUCT FROM WHAT WAS ULTIMATELY DISCOVERED TO BE WEEPING OF THE CLAMP.      ON OCTOBER 20TH AT APPROXIMATELY 16:00 CREWS DETERMINED THAT THE CLAMP WAS WEEPING AND THAT RESIDUAL PRODUCT HAD BEEN RELEASED.  DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF RESIDUAL CRUDE OIL AND ANTICIPATED TOTAL COSTS EXCEEDING $50,000 THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED ON OCTOBER 20, 2018 (REPORT 1228043) WITH FOLLOW UP NRC (REPORT 1228252) ALSO COMPLETED.    IN ORDER FOR THE CREW TO ENTER THE EXCAVATION PRESSURES WERE REDUCED TO A SAFE LEVEL AND THE EXCAVATION WAS CONTINUALLY VACUUMED TO PREVENT COLLECTION OF RAINWATER.  ONCE ABLE TO ACCESS THE CLAMP THE CREW LOOSENED THE BOLTS, REPOSITIONED THE CLAMP AND TORQUED THE BOLTS BACK TO MANUFACTURER SPECIFICATIONS.  THIS ACTIVITY ALLOWED THE CLAMP TO FULLY SEAL AND HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TEST ACTIVITIES RESUMED ULTIMATELY ACHIEVING A SUCCESSFUL TEST ON OCTOBER 29, 2018.

THE PRODUCER WAS TO REMOVE TWO METER RUNS.  THE VALVES AT THE ENDS OF EACH METER RUN HAD BEEN CLOSED AND LOCKED AT SOME EARLIER DATE BY ANR PERSONNEL.  AT THE TIME OF PLANNED FACILITY DISCONNECTION AND REMOVAL, THE PRODUCER PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE METER RUN ISOLATION VALVES WERE LEAKING AND DECIDED TO ISOLATE ADDITIONAL PIPING ON THE PLATFORM IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT NO GAS COULD MIGRATE TO THE MEASUREMENT PIPING.  TO FACILITATE THIS ADDITIONAL ISOLATION ACTIVITY, WHICH WAS NOT PART OF THE PROJECT SCOPE AND HAD NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY ANR MANAGEMENT, PRODUCER PERSONNEL CLOSED VALVES TO GAS SOURCES, OPENED THE PIG TRAP KICKER LINE VALVE, AND THEN OPENED THE 4' PIG TRAP VENT VALVE THROUGH WHICH THIS ISOLATED PIPING WAS EVACUATED.  AS THE PIPING AND PIG TRAP WERE BLOWING DOWN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PRESSURE IN THE PIG TRAP AND ASSOCIATED PIPING WOULD NOT DROP TO ATMOSPHERIC.  PRODUCER PERSONNEL PRESUMED THAT ONE OF THE VALVES THEY HAD CLOSED TO ISOLATED THE PIPING FROM A GAS SOURCE MUST NOT HAVE COMPLETELY CLOSED.  IT WAS DECIDED TO ATTEMPT TO FURTHER CLOSE THE VALVE.  HOWEVER, RATHER THAN USING THE HAND PUMP TO OPERATE THE VALVE, PRODUCER PERSONNEL USED THE POWER GAS OPERATOR AND MISTAKENLY PARTLY OPENED THE VALVE.  THIS ALLOWED HIGH PRESSURE GAS (APPROXIMATELY 860 PSIG) TO ENTER THE PARTIALLY BLOWN DOWN PIPING WITH A HIGH DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE OPENED VENT VALVE.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PIG TRAP VENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH WAS MOUNTED AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION ON THE TRAP BOTTLE, INCLUDED A VENT STACK THAT WAS CONFIGURED WITH A 90 DEGREE BEND INTENDED TO VENT GAS AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM.   DUE TO THE SUDDEN INCREASE IN GAS PRESSURE AND FLOW THROUGH THE VENT VALVE ASSEMBLY AND THE RESULTANT HIGH VELOCITY GAS EXITING THE 90 DEGREE VENT STACK, ENOUGH FORCE WAS PRODUCED TO CAUSE THE ENTIRE VENT ASSEMBLY TO FAIL AND DISCONNECT NEAR THE PIG TRAP BOTTLE.  FOLLOWING THE FAILURE, THE VENT VALVE ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN REBUILT AND REINSTALLED ON THE PIG TRAP.

SHORTLY BEFORE 11:51 AM CT, EPNG OPERATIONS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF FLAMES ON THE EPNG RIGHT-OF-WAY (ROW) AND BY 12:16 PM CT HAD ISOLATED THE L3130 VALVE SECTION AND MONITORED PRESSURES ON THE ISOLATED SEGMENT AND CONFIRMED THAT THE PIPELINE WAS HOLDING PRESSURE.   AN EPNG OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR WENT TO THE SITE OF THE RUPTURE AT 12:20 PM CT AND VISUALLY CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS THE NAVITAS MIDSTREAM PARTNERS' LINE THAT HAD RUPTURED. EPNG WAS GETTING READY TO BLOW DOWN ITS LINE WHEN THE RUPTURE OF THE EPNG LINE OCCURRED. AT 12:33 PM CT, EPNG'S RTU DATA LOG AT JAMESON CHECK METER ON L3130 SHOWED A ""HIGH-HIGH"" ALARM.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30 PM CT.  AT APPROXIMATELY 12:44 PM CT, EPNG GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE EPNG OPERATIONS AT THE SITE STATING THAT ITS LINE HAD BEEN COMPROMISED.  THREE NAVITAS EMPLOYEES, A NAVITAS CONTRACTOR EMPLOYED BY QIS AND THE EPNG OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR WERE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. ONE NAVITAS EMPLOYEE LATER DIED FROM HIS INJURIES. TWO FIREFIGHTERS WERE TREATED AND RELEASED AT THE HOSPITAL THE SAME DAY, AS WAS ONE OF THE NAVITAS EMPLOYEES.  EPNG NOTIFIED THE NRC (NO. 1220198) AT 13:29 PM CT OF THE INCIDENT INVOLVING EPNG'S L3130 WITH AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED AND POSSIBLY CAUSED BY A FIRE ON A THIRD PARTY PIPELINE WITHIN THE ROW.     THE NRC LOGGED THE REPORT AT 13:46 PM CT. EPNG PROVIDED A 48-HOUR NOTICE TO THE NRC (NO. 1220423) ON AUGUST 3, 2018 AT 11:51 CT TO UPDATE INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT, ESTIMATED VOLUME OF UNINTENTIONAL NATURAL GAS RELEASED, AND A REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE OPERATOR OF THE THIRD PARTY PIPELINE THAT ONE OF ITS EMPLOYEE'S INJURIES WERE FATAL.  EPNG ISSUED ANOTHER REVISED NOTICE NRC (NO. 1220429) TO CORRECT THE TOTAL VOLUME OF UNINTENTIONAL NATURAL GAS RELEASED. THE CORRECT RELEASE VOLUME WAS 1,060 MSCF AT THE TIME OF THE 48 HOUR NOTICE.       THE INVESTIGATION UTILIZED THE METALLURGICAL DATA COLLECTED FROM THE EVENT AND THE DNV SYSTEMATIC CAUSE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE (SCAT) ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS TOOL PER KINDER MORGAN/EPNG PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE BASIC CAUSE, ROOT CAUSE AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.    BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION REPORT, WHICH WAS PROVIDED TO PHMSA, THE BASIC/ROOT CAUSES WERE DETERMINED TO BE ""12.1 INADEQUATE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE"" - PER THE METALLURGY FINDINGS, THE NAVITAS LINE WAS LEAKING EVEN PRIOR TO THE RUPTURE. NAVITAS HAD NOT IDENTIFIED THE LEAK, THE SELECTIVE ERW SEAM CORROSION, NOR CONDUCTED REPAIRS/MAINTENANCE AND . ""14.4 INADEQUATE MONITORING OF COMPLIANCE"" - AFTER THE NAVITAS LINE RUPTURED, NAVITAS PERSONNEL DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE NAVITAS LINE WAS BURNING AND ARGUED WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM KINDER MORGAN/EPNG, WHO TRIED TO TELL NAVITAS PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE THAT IT WAS THE NAVITAS LINE OBSERVED TO BE ON FIRE.  THE INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE INITIAL RUPTURE LOCATION WAS AT THE NAVITAS H-LOOP (NPS 6) LINE AND IT CONTINUED TO BURN FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT UNTIL THE EVENING OF AUGUST 3, 2018. DURING THIS TIME, NAVITAS REPORTED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE FUEL FOR THE FIRE COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED.

COMPANY PERSONAL RESPONDED WITH SUPPORT FROM CONTRACTORS TO EXCAVATE THE AREA, COLLECT AND PROPERLY STORE FOR DISPOSAL, ALL AFFECTED GROUND WATER. THE PIPELINE WAS DOWN ALREADY PER THE PUMPING SCHEDULE. LINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED DURING EXPLORATORY EXCAVATION WORK. A CRACK WAS FOUND ON THE OUTSIDE OF A 90° BEND DURING A LOW PRESSURE TEST. THE PIPELINE WAS DRAINED VIA ELEVATION DRAIN UP AND THE DEFECTIVE BEND WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW HYDRO-STATICALLY TESTED BEND. ALL INSTALLATION WELDS WERE NON-DESTRUCTIVELY TESTED. BEFORE THE LINE WAS RESTARTED, PRESSURE CONTROLLING DEVICES WERE SET TO 80% OF THE HIGHEST PRESSURE RECORDED DURING THE LAST 60 DAYS PRIOR TO DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE. THE DEFECTIVE BEND WAS SENT TO KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE METALLURGICAL REPORT FROM KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES CONCLUDES THAT THERE WERE FOUR CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT LED TO THE CRACK FOUND ON THE PIPE BEND. THESE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS, IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, ARE TWO SMALL NOTCHES IN THE PIPE AT THE LEAK SITE, STRESS ON THE BEND LIKELY RELATED TO THE INSTALLATION OF THE PIPE, HARDNESS OF THE METAL AT THE SITE OF THE BEND LIKELY RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THE BEND, AND SLIGHT CORROSION DUE TO A SEPARATION OF THE COATING WHICH ALLOWED WATER TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE BEND.

OCTOBER 25, 2018: RECOVERY OF STANDING COMMODITY COMPLETED, SECTION CUTOUT AND PIPELINE REPAIRED AND RETURNED TO SERVICE.  CUTOUT SENT FOR METALLURGICAL TESTING.    DECEMBER 12, 2018 METALLURGICAL REPORT CONCLUDED THAT (1) ELECTROCHEMICAL EXTERNAL PITTING CORROSION CAUSED THE LEAK IN THE FITTING.

INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE TWO CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE CAUSE OF THE EXTERNAL CORROSION:  1. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR - ABSENCE OF CATHODIC PROTECTION (CP) WAS CAUSED BY A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE CUSTODY TRANSFER BETWEEN CRGC PIPELINE ENDED AND THE THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE BEGAN.      CORRECTIVE ACTION - AREA WHERE THE LEAK AND EXTERNAL CORROSION WERE FOUND WAS PLACED UNDER CP. REVIEWED FACILITY PIPING AND RISERS TO LOCATE ANY ADDITIONAL AREAS WITHOUT CP.  ALL OTHER AREAS MET THE CP CRITERIA.  VERIFIED THAT THERE IS A CLEAR DEMARCATION OF THE CUSTODY TRANSFER POINT BETWEEN CRGC PIPELINE AND THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE.    2.  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR - INADEQUATE COATING APPLICATION PRACTICES AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION LED TO DISBONDED COATING.  CORRECTIVE ACTION - DAMAGED PIPE AND FITTINGS WERE REPLACED WITH NEW PIPE AND FITTINGS.  NEW COATING AND PROPER COATING APPLICATION WAS APPLIED.  TWO ADDITIONAL 90 ELBOWS ADJACENT TO THE FAILURE WERE INSPECTED FOR EXTERNAL CORROSION AND BOTH WERE RECOATED WITH FBE COATING.

THE INITIAL RELEASE WAS ESTIMATED AT 1-2 BARRELS WITH ALL OIL CONTAINED IN TANK SECONDARY CONTAINMENT.  THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED AND CREWS WERE DISPATCHED TO RESPOND AND CLEAN UP THE RELEASE.  THE INITIAL DETERMINATION OF THE CAUSE WAS THE TANK ROOF DRAIN VALVE FAILED TO PROPERLY SEAL AND IT WAS UNKNOWN AT THE TIME HOW OIL GOT INTO THE DRAIN LINE.  INITIAL COST ESTIMATE WAS LESS THAN $50,000 TO CLEANUP AND PERFORM AN IN-PLACE REPAIR OF THE VALVE BY REPACKING IT.  NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (CASE ID# 190318-0406-ADC) ON MARCH 18, 2019 AT 4:05 AM CDT AS THE QUANTITY RELEASE AMOUNT WAS CLOSE TO MISSOURI'S 50 GALLONS CRITERIA.      AFTER COMPLETING PERMITS TO INSPECT THE TANK ROOF, PERSONNEL DISCOVERED ANOTHER ESTIMATED 25 BARRELS HAD BEEN RELEASED ONTO THE TANK ROOF AT 5:36 AM CDT, WHICH INCREASED THE COSTS OF REMEDIATION TO GREATER THAN $50,000. THE NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE ON MARCH 18, 2019 AT 5:56 AM CDT (REPORT #1240350).  THE ESTIMATED RELEASE INTO SECONDARY CONTAINMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 BARRELS AND THE ESTIMATED RELEASE ON THE TANK ROOF WAS APPROXIMATELY 25 BARRELS.  THE 48-HOUR NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE ON MARCH 19, 2019 AT 7:00 PM CDT (REPORT #1240500) TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON RELEASE VOLUME.     THE RELEASE HAS BEEN CLEANED UP IN THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT AND ON THE TANK ROOF.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE CAUSE OF THE ROOF DRAIN FAILURE WAS DETERMINED TO BE FROM WATER THAT FROZE IN THE DRAIN LINE CAUSING A BREAK IN THE PIVOT MASTER CONNECTION.  A PLUG WAS INSTALLED IN THE ROOF DRAIN ON THE TANK ROOF TO PREVENT FURTHER PRODUCT FROM COLLECTING ON THE ROOF.  THE TANK WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE TO REPAIR THE DAMAGED DRAIN COMPONENTS AT A LATER DATE TO BE DETERMINED.

THE DATE AND TIME OF THE RELEASE (07/24/2019 AT 13:22) IS INDICATIVE OF THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME THE RELEASE COULD HAVE STARTED, AS IT WAS THE LAST TIME THE LOCATION HAD BEEN VISITED AND CONFIRMED THAT NO CRUDE OIL WAS BEING RELEASE.  TO STOP THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF OIL, PLAINS PLACED A CLAMP ON THE RELEASE LOCATION.  THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED, PENDING THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE.     SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:  FOLLOWING THIRD PARTY FAILURE ANALYSIS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A VERY NARROW AND SHARP INTERNAL PIT AND WAS LOCATED WITHIN AN AREA OF ACCUMULATED SOLIDS. MICROORGANISMS LIKELY PLAYED A PRIMARY ROLE IN THE CORROSION MECHANISM. PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, THE RELEASE LOCATION WAS IDENTIFIED USING PHASED ARRAY ULTRASONIC TESTING (PAUT) WHICH IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY 76% METAL LOSS.  HOWEVER, THE LOCATION PASSED THREE INDUSTRY ACCEPTED METHODS OF PRESSURE CALCULATIONS, AND THEREFORE THE FAILURE LOCATION DID NOT HAVE A TEMPORARY REPAIR INSTALLED PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.

FOLLOWING THE ARRIVAL AND INVESTIGATION OF THE SITE, THE TECHNICIAN CONCLUDED THAT DEAD VEGETATION AND ELEVATED LEVELS OF METHANE, AS MEASURED BY A GAS DETECTOR, IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPELINE WAS LIKELY DUE TO A GAS RELEASE.  THE SUSPECTED  GAS RELEASE PROMPTED A CALL TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND AN INCIDENT REPORT (NRC #1152118) WAS FILED AT 15:23 ET ON 30 JUNE 2016. THE SECTION OF PIPE WAS ISOLATED AND THE PRESSURE REDUCED TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.    FOLLOWING EXCAVATION OF THE LOCATION, A GIRTHWELD FEATURE WAS DISCOVERED AND PRESUMED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE GAS RELEASE.  A 14 FOOT SECTION INCLUDING THE GIRTH WELD WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH NEW PIPE. THE PIPE SECTION CONTAINING THE GIRTH WELD WAS SUBMITTED TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS.    THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON 31 AUGUST 2016 AT 13:30 LOCAL TIME.    LABORATORY ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT LEAKING FLAW WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF AN INCOMPLETE FUSION ALONG THE ROOT PASS COUPLED WITH POROSITY IN FILL AND CAP FILL PASSES DURING INITIAL FABRICATION. THE INCOMPLETE FUSION AND POROSITY, IN COMBINATION, RESULTED IN AN AREA WHERE THE LOCAL TENSILE CAPACITY WAS LIMITED.

AT THE TIME, THE PIPELINE WAS NOT IN OPERATION BUT WAS HOLDING APPROXIMATELY 189 PSI OF STATIC PRESSURE.  DUE TO THE RELIEF VALVE FAILING OPEN THE STATIC PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE BLED OFF THROUGH THE RELIEF VALVE AND CAUSED THE TANK TO OVERFILL.",776.0,1.0,540.0,35.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.17,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AS PART OF THE EMERGENCY SAFETY FIRE-GATE PROCESS, THE PLANT RELEASED NATURAL GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH PLANT 3 BLOWDOWN SILENCERS.    THE NATURAL GAS RELEASED FROM THE FIRE-GATE EVENT MIGRATED IN A NORTHEAST DIRECTION OVER THE PLANT 2  PROCESSING EQUIPMENT AS A RESULT OF THE WIND CONDITIONS OCCURRING AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:25 A.M., A GAS PLUME IGNITED FROM THE PLANT 3 BLOWDOWN SILENCERS (SUCTION AND DISCHARGE). THE PLANT 2 THERMAL OXIDIZER'S 1506 DEGREES F EXHAUST STREAM AUTO-IGNITED THE PLANT 3 FIRE-GATE GAS PLUME.    PERSONNEL AT THE RAY PLANT MANUALLY FIRE-GATED PLANT 1 AND PLANT 2, AS PART OF OUR STANDARD SAFETY  PROTOCOLS, AT 10:27:58 A.M. AND 10:28:22 A.M., RESPECTIVELY. AT 10:28:48 A.M., THERE WAS A SECOND  IGNITION AT THE PLANT 2 VENT STACK, WHICH IS LOCATED NEXT TO PLANT 3'S BLOWDOWN SILENCERS AND IS THE  LOCATION WHERE THE NATURAL GAS IS RELEASED FOR PLANT 2.  THE ARMANDA TOWNSHIP FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED AT 10:29 A.M. AND ARRIVED ONSITE AT 10:38. THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS REMAINED AT THE SITE UNTIL ALL THE NATURAL GAS WAS VENTED FROM THE PIPING TO ADDRESS REMAINING FIRE AND HOTSPOTS.     A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA) TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED AND MET ON SITE FEBRUARY 2, 2019 TO IDENTIFY THE IGNITION SOURCE INITIATING THE FIRE AT THE RAY COMPRESSOR STATION PLANT 3 BLOW DOWN SILENCERS AND DEFINE HOW TO CONTROL AND PREVENT RE-OCCURRENCE. (REFER TO MPSC STAFF' INVESTIGATION REPORT APPENDIX A)    FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE DET-TRONICS FAILURE LEADING TO THE FIREGATE ACTIVATION REVEALED THAT A GROUNDING FAULT WAS THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE INITIAL FIREGATE EVENT. WHEN THE STATION'S [DOMESTIC WATER] WELL PUMP STARTED UP, ITS VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVE CAUSED A VOLTAGE SPIKE IN THE GROUNDING SYSTEM OF THE DET-TRONICS PANEL LOCATED IN THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING. THESE HIGH VOLTAGES CAUSED ENHANCED DISCRETE INPUT/OUTPUT (EDIO) AND ANALOG INPUT MODULE (AIM) TO LOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE DET-TRONICS PILOT AIR SYSTEM, A FAULT WHICH TRIGGERED THE INITIAL FIREGATE.    TO ELIMINATE THE GROUNDING VOLTAGE INTO THE DET-TRONICS SYSTEM, THE WELL PUMP PRESSURE SWITCH AND  PRESSURE TRANSMITTER WERE RELOCATED TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE PLANT 3 AUXILIARY BUILDING. THE RISK OF A  COMMUNICATIONS BREAK-DOWN BETWEEN THE PILOT AIR SYSTEM AND ITS MODULES HAS BEEN MITIGATED BY RELOCATING THE MODULES FROM THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING TO THE PLANT 3 AUXILIARY BUILDING.

THE ON DUTY OPERATOR NOTICED THAT THE STATION CONTINUED TO BLOW DOWN BEYOND DURATION OF A NORMAL SHUTDOWN AND CALLED THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR AND STATION PERSONNEL FOR ASSISTANCE IN LOCATING THE SOURCE OF THE CONTINUAL GAS RELEASE. THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR ARRIVED ON SITE AND TOGETHER WITH THE OPERATOR AND STATION PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THAT THE STATION HEADER SUCTION VALVE, AS-1, AND DISCHARGE VALVE, AD-3, HAD NOT CLOSED AS DESIGNED. THE OPERATOR AND THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL (OPERATIONS SPECIALIST) MANUALLY CLOSED THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES AND STOPPED THE GAS RELEASE AT 2:45AM ON JANUARY 31, 2019. THE STATION VENTED FOR A TOTAL OF 37 MINUTES AND THE TOTAL GAS RELEASE WAS 55,924 MCF.  THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ESD PUSH BUTTON 5 HAD HAD MOISTURE ENTER THE CASING AND CAUSED CORROSION ON THE BUTTON. ON THE DAY OF THIS EVENT, THE EXTREMELY COLD TEMPERATURES (-4 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT) CAUSED THE MOISTURE IN THE CASING TO FREEZE THEREFORE OPENING THE CIRCUIT ON THE BUTTON AND INITIATING THE ESD. IN ADDITION, MOISTURE HAD GOTTEN IN TO THE AS-1 SUCTION VALVE ACTUATOR AND AD-3 DISCHARGE VALVE ACTUATOR AND THE EXTREMELY COLD WEATHER CAUSED THE VALVE O-RINGS TO FREEZE, PREVENTING THEM FROM CLOSING.

THE DAMAGED PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS REMOVED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND PIPELINE ENDS STABILIZED.    ON AUGUST 27, 2021 ADV INTEGRITY ISSUED A ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS TO HILCORP AS FOLLOWS:    1. THE SUBJECT FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO A TIME-DEPENDENT CRACKING MECHANISM, LIKELY FATIGUE, WHICH WAS LIKELY EXACERBATED BY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. THE FEATURES IDENTIFIED WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL PIPELINE STRESS CORROSION CRACKING.  2. THE LOCAL STRESS STATE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED THROUGH-WALL CRACK. THIS LOCAL STRESS STATE INCLUDED: (1) THE HIGH TENSILE LOAD RESULTING FROM THE PIPE'S CONTOUR ACROSS THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, (2) THE PRESENCE OF THE PLIDCO CLAMP IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE FAILURE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE RIGIDITY OF THE PIPELINE, AND (3) THE REDUCED WALL THICKNESS AS A RESULT OF EXTERNAL CORROSION AND ABRASION.  3. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PIPE AND GIRTH WELD WERE CONSISTENT WITH API 5L, GRADE B MATERIAL.    SUBPART K SELECTION DESCRIPTIONS:    - PREVIOUS MECHANICAL DAMAGE NOT RELATED TO EXCAVATION: THE PREVIOUS OWNER INSTALLED A PLIDCO PIPE CLAMP IN 2014 JUST UPSTREAM OF THE FAILURE LOCATION. IMPROPER SUPPORT OF THE PIPELINE DURING AND AFTER LIFTING COULD ALSO IMPART RESULTING STRESS AT AND NEARBY THE PLIDCO.    - EXTERNAL CORROSION, GALVANIC: REDUCED WALL THICKNESS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION AND ABRASION WHERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF THE LEAK.    - INSTALLATION RELATED: INCREASED TENSILE LOAD RESULTING FROM THE PIPE'S CONTOUR ACROSS THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, AND THE INCREASED RIGIDITY FROM THE NEAR BY PLIDCO CLAMP INCREASING THE STRESS CONCENTRATION FACTOR IN THAT LOCATION.    THIS PIPELINE WILL NOT BE BROUGHT BACK INTO SERVICE AS HILCORP HAS DECIDED TO PURSUE THE ABANDONMENT OF THIS LINE.

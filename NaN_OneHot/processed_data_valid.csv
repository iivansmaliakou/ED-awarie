THE TECHNICIAN WENT OUTSIDE TO DISCOVER AN ESD SYSTEM VENT VALVE, ESV-303, 100% OPEN.  THE TECHNICIAN THEN VERIFIED THERE WAS NOT AN ACTIVE ESD CONDITION ON THE STATION CONTROL COMPUTER.  THE TECHNICIAN THEN PHONED A STATION OPERATOR TO ASSIST.  THE STATION OPERATOR ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:20 AM AND CLOSED A 12 INCH VALVE TO ISOLATE THE STATION FROM L-25.  THE GAS RELEASE THROUGH ESV-303 IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO DECREASE.  AS THE NOISE GENERATED BY THE VENTING GAS SUBSIDED, THE OPERATOR THEN HEARD GAS BLOWING FROM A SECOND VENT VALVE, ESV-193, WITHIN THE COMPRESSOR YARD.  THE OPERATOR THEN CLOSED A 16 INCH VALVE TO ISOLATE THE STATION FROM L-127.  WITH THE STATION COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM ALL CONNECTING PIPELINES, THE STATION PIPING QUICKLY VENTED TO ATMOSPHERE AND WAS FULLY DEPRESSURED AT 10:26 AM.  THE I&E TECHNICIAN RETURNED TO THE CONTROL COMPUTER TO FIND AN ACTIVE ESD ALARM AND A UNIT 1056 COMPRESSOR SHUTDOWN ALARM HAD OCCURRED WHILE HE WAS OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE.  AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT.  THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE INADVERTENT GAS RELEASE WAS CAUSED BY THE UNPLANNED OPENING OF TWO ACTUATED EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN VENT VALVES DUE TO INADEQUATE PILOT GAS PRESSURE.  AN INSPECTION OF PILOT GAS SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MATTER SUCH AS PIPE SCALE, PIPELINE CONTAMINANTS, ETC. WILL BE PERFORMED.  IN ADDITION, THE CONTINUED USE OF THE VALVE OPERATORS CURRENTLY INSTALLED ON THE EMERGENCY VENT VALVES WILL BE EVALUATED.

STAGE PUMP #2 WAS NOT IN OPERATION AT THE TIME OF SEAL FAILURE SO THE PUMP DISCHARGE VALVE WAS ALREADY CLOSED; HOWEVER, THE EMPLOYEE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE PUMP SUCTION VALVE WHICH ISOLATED THE PUMP AND STOPPED THE RELEASE.  THE EMPLOYEE THEN CALLED THEIR SUPERVISOR AND REPORTED THE RELEASE.  THE SUPERVISOR THEN DISPATCHED ANOTHER OPERATIONS EMPLOYEE TO ASSIST WITH THE RELEASE AND A VAC TRUCK OPERATOR WAS CONTACTED TO RECOVER THE FREE PRODUCT FROM THE PUMP CONCRETE CONTAINMENT AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 10 BARRELS OF FREE PRODUCT WERE RECOVERED AND RE-INJECTED BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. THE FAILED PUMP MECHANICAL SEAL WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A VENDOR TO BE EXAMINED AND REBUILT. THE VENDOR'S PRELIMINARY VERBAL REPORT INDICATED A MANUFACTURING DEFECT LED TO THE SEAL FAILURE.  A NEW MECHANICAL SEAL WAS INSTALLED IN THE PUMP SO IT COULD BE PLACED INTO SERVICE WHEN NEEDED.     THE RELEASE WAS COMPLETELY CONTAINED ON COMPANY OWNED PROPERTY AND DID NOT LEAVE THE SITE.  NO SURFACE WATER, GROUND WATER OR WILDLIFE WERE IMPACTED BY THE RELEASE; HOWEVER, A SMALL AMOUNT OF CRUDE OIL DID BREACH THE TOP OF THE PUMP CONCRETE CONTAINMENT AREA, WHICH RESULTED AN APPROXIMATELY 10 X 6 FOOT AREA OF SOIL CONTAMINATED TO A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 1 INCH.

THIS LED TO THE DEFORMATION AND PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE RELIEF VALVE BELLOWS.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE, THE CHECK VALVE FAILURE, WAS DETERMINED TO BE EXCESSIVE VIBRATION.  NEW DAMPENERS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED TO REDUCE FUTURE VIBRATION AND PREVENT AN INCIDENT REOCCURRENCE.    ADDITIONALLY, NEW RELIEF VALVES HAVE BEEN INSTALLED WITH A NEW PIPING CONFIGURATION TO PREVENT SIMILAR CONSEQUENCES IN THE FUTURE.  WHILE THESE CHANGES DO NOT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE CHECK VALVE FAILURE, THE CHANGES DO REDUCE THE CONSEQUENCES OF POTENTIAL FUTURE SYSTEM UPSETS.

ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE REGULATORS FOR THE CONTROL GAS TO THE POSITIONER ON THE CONTROL VALVE FAILED, WHICH RESULTED IN EXCESSIVE PRESSURE BEYOND THE CONTROL VALVE AND THE OPENING OF THE RELIEF VALVE PROVIDING OVER-PRESSURE PROTECTION TO THE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEM.  AFTER THE RELIEF VALVE OPENED, THE VALVE FAILED TO RE-SEAT DUE TO A PIECE OF WELD SLAG ON THE SEAT OF THE RELIEF.  IN RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT, CREWS SHUT THE INLET VALVE TO THE REGULATOR STATION, HOWEVER THE RELIEF CONTINUED TO VENT DUE TO THE SLAG ON SEAT OF THE RELIEF.  THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED AT APPROXIMATELY 8:59 AM WHEN THE OUTLET VALVE TO THE STATION WAS CLOSED.    THE INCIDENT IS BEING REPORTED ON THE BASIS OF THE VOLUMETRIC REPORTING CRITERIA.    SUBSEQUENT TO THE INCIDENT, AND BEFORE RETURNING THE STATION TO SERVICE, A DEDICATED FILTER WAS PLACED IN FRONT OF THE REGULATORS TO THE INSTRUMENT GAS TO MINIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF RE-OCCURRENCE.  ADDITIONALLY, A RELIEF VALVE WAS ADDED TO THE INSTRUMENT GAS LINES AS SUPPLEMENTAL OVER-PRESSURE PROTECTION AND SUPPLY GAS TUBING LINES WERE RELOCATED TO MINIMIZE VIBRATION.

INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE AND LINE 2 WAS SHUT DOWN FROM HEBERT STATION TO BATON ROUGE JUNCTION. THE SOURCE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A FAILED PACKING ON THE DISCHARGE VALVE. ALL RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED ON COMPANY PROPERTY IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA, FLOATING ON RAINWATER WHICH HAD COLLECTED IN THE STATION YARD.  PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED USING ABSORBENTS AND THE STATION OIL WATER SEPARATOR.  CLEANUP AND VALVE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AND THE LINE 2 SEGMENT FROM HEBERT TO BATON ROUGE WAS RESTARTED AT 18:20.  CHURCH POINT STATION LINE 2 WAS RESTARTED AT 18:55. DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO WHERE THE PRODUCT WAS INITIALLY DISCOVERED IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT THE DISCHARGE VALVE WAS THE MOST PROBABLE SOURCE OF A SIMILAR RELEASE THAT OCCURRED ON MARCH 9TH 2015 WHERE THE LEAK SOURCE WAS NEVER IDENTIFIED.     DETAILS OF THE 9 MARCH 2015 RELEASE ARE AS FOLLOWS:  AT 12:00 ON MARCH 9, 2015, A COLONIAL EMPLOYEE OBSERVED DIESEL FUEL FLOATING ON TOP OF PONDED RAINWATER AT CHURCH POINT BOOSTER STATION NEAR THE LINE 2 STATION DISCHARGE CHECK VALVE AND CONTROL VALVE. THERE HAD BEEN HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE AREA, AND THERE WERE POOLS OF STANDING WATER THROUGHOUT THE STATION YARD. INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE AND THE LINE 2 STATION LOOP WAS ISOLATED FROM MAINLINE OPERATIONS. A CREW ARRIVED AND EXCAVATED THE LINE 2 DISCHARGE CHECK VALVE AND PERFORMED OTHER EXPLORATORY EXCAVATIONS WITHIN THE AREA. NO ACTIVE LEAK SOURCE WAS IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED. CONTINUOUS MONITORING WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE STATION WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 18:50. THE STATION WAS MONITORED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WITH NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT SIGHTED. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, A CREW USED PORTABLE PUMPS TO MOVE STANDING WATER FROM THE STATION YARD TO THE STATION OIL WATER SEPARATOR AND THEN ON TO A FACILITY CONVEYANCE DITCH WHICH LEADS TO THE STATION RETENTION POND. THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS NEVER POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED. HOWEVER, A SMALL PRODUCT SHEEN WAS OBSERVED ON A PORTION OF THE RETENTION POND.  AS A RESULT, AN NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE ON MARCH 10TH, 2015 AT 19:02 (REPORT NUMBER 1110222). NOTIFICATIONS WERE ALSO MADE TO THE LOUISIANA DEQ-SPOC AND THE ACADIA PARISH LEPC AND A COURTESY CALL WAS MADE TO PHMSA. ALL PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED ON COMPANY PROPERTY AND APPROXIMATELY 10 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL WAS RECOVERED. CHURCH POINT BOOSTER STATION WAS STAFFED CONTINUOUSLY THROUGH THE AFTERNOON OF 3/12/15 AND INSPECTED DAILY THROUGH 3/20/15. NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT WAS FOUND AND THE LEAK SOURCE WAS NEVER IDENTIFIED. BASED ON GUIDANCE FROM A PHMSA INSPECTOR, AN ACCIDENT REPORT WAS NOT SUBMITTED TO PHMSA SINCE THE LEAK SOURCE COULD NOT BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED.",13295.0,0.0,720.0,35.27777777777778,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.22,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AT 05:19-HOURS, GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A SCADA ALARM.  THE CONTROLLER ON DUTY, USING THE CALL-OUT SYSTEM, NOTIFIED THE PROPER OPERATIONS PERSONNEL AT THAT TIME.      AT 06:04-HOURS, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT ELLERSLIE COMPRESSOR STATION AND CONFIRMED NATURAL GAS WAS VENTING.  UPON SAFELY ENTERING THE COMPRESSOR STATION PROPERTY, THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL BEGAN INSPECTING THE COMPRESSOR STATION TO DETERMINE WHY NATURAL GAS WAS STILL VENTING FOLLOWING THE ESD FUNCTION.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL FOUND VALVE #19 WHICH IS PART OF THE ESD SYSTEM LOCATED IN THE SUCTION SIDE OF THE STATION PIPING, HAD NOT FULLY CLOSED.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVE #19 AND THE STATION WAS SHUT DOWN AT 6:30-HOURS.  FIELD OPERATIONS INITIATED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE (ERL) PROCESS FOLLOWING INTERNAL PROCEDURES AND THE INCIDENT WAS DEEMED REPORTABLE DURING THE ERL CALL.     AS PART OF SNG'S POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION PROCESS THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ON SITE DISCOVERED AN EXIT POINT IN THE COMPRESSOR STATION YARD WITH SOME ICE FORMED NEAR AN UNDERGROUND ESD FACILITY PIPE.  SNG STARTED THE EXCAVATION PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE UNDERGROUND LEAK.  AFTER EXPOSING THE UNDERGROUND ESD PIPE, SNG DISCOVERED THAT THE 1/2-INCH ESD PIPE HAD A CRACK IN A THREADED CONNECTION.     DURING THE ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CRACKED UNDERGROUND ESD PIPE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ESD EVENT.  FURTHERMORE, THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT VALVE #19 DID NOT FULLY CLOSE AS DESIGNED ALLOWING THE VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED TO BE ABOVE THE PHMSA REPORTABLE THRESHOLD.     OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT EXPEDITED A CONTRACTOR TO COME ON SITE AND REPAIR THE BURIED 1/2-INCH ESD LINE.  THE CRACKED PIPE WAS SENT TO A LAB FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND THE LINE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 26, 2020.      OPERATIONS PERSONNEL CHECKED AND CYCLED VALVE #19 WITH NO ISSUE.  VALVE #19 IS CLOSED AND LOCKED OUT OF SERVICE.  SNG OPERATIONS HAS ORDERED A NEW SHAFER OPERATOR FOR 2021 INSTALLATION.       WITH GENERAL SAFETY INSPECTION OF THE COMPRESSOR STATION AND COORDINATION WITH GAS CONTROL, THE COMPRESSOR STATION RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 22:15-HOURS, DECEMBER 26, 2020.    THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE 1/2-INCH ESD LINE PIPE SPECIMEN DETERMINED THE CRACK OCCURRED BECAUSE OF HIGH CYCLE, LOW NOMINAL STRESS BENDING FATIGUE INITIATING IN THE ROOT OF THE THREADS.  THE ANALYSIS ALSO NOTED THE STEEL PIPE CHEMISTRY DID NOT MEET ASTM A53 GRADE B STANDARDS DUE TO HIGHER PHOSPHORUS CONTENT.  HOWEVER, TESTING FOUND THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE STEEL MEETS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF ASTM A53 GRADE B.

PROJECT AND DISTRICT PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED AROUND 21:00.  CONTRACTOR AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE SOURCE OF THE SHEEN AND LATER FOUND A 3' X 3' AREA OF PRODUCT STAINED SURFACE SOIL LOCATED OVER THE TOP OF LINE 27 AND ADJACENT TO A CULVERT PIPE THAT DISCHARGES TO THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT POND.  BOOM WAS PLACED ON THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT POND AND, AS A PRECAUTION, THE DOWNSTREAM STORM WATER RETENTION POND.  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL WERE CALLED IN TO ASSIST WITH EXCAVATING THE AREA THE FOLLOWING MORNING.  BY THE NEXT MORNING (MAY 2), THERE WAS NO VISIBLE SIGN OF PRODUCT ON THE SURFACE OF THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT POND.  SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AND STOCKPILED ON PLASTIC PENDING OFF-SITE DISPOSAL TO EXPOSE LINE 27 FOR INSPECTION.   THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE A HAIRLINE CRACK ON THE WELD OF A HISTORICAL REPAIR.  THE PRIOR REPAIR WAS A BOLT-ON-CLAMP THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1986 (BASED ON PRIOR BREAK & LEAK REPORT) TO ADDRESS HAIRLINE CRACK IN THE PIPELINE. THE LEAK OCCURRED ALONG THE LONGITUDAL SEAM WELD OF THE PRIOR REPAIR.  OBSERVATIONS BY NED FIELD PROJECT MANAGER AND PROJECT INSPECTOR INDICATED THAT THE WELD WAS A FILLET WELD.  AFTER DETERMINING THE REPAIR THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY (SEE BELOW),  COLONIAL CONFIRMED THAT COSTS TO RESPOND TO THE INCIDENT WERE GREATER THAN $50K, AND MADE NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NRC AND PHMSA AID ON MAY 2, 2018.  THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY PLACING A TYPE B PRESSURE CONTAINING SLEEVE OVER THE PRIOR REPAIR TO CONTAIN THE LEAK.  THE TYPE B SLEEVE WAS A STACKED SLEEVE REPAIR.    FINAL REPORT UPDATE:    AN INCIDENT ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED.  WHILE A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WAS NOT COMPLETED ON THE FAILED WELD, AN ENGINEERING REVIEW OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE CRACK IN THE LONGITUDINAL FILET WELD OF THE BOLT-ON-CLAMP LIKELY FORMED DUE TO A COMBINATION OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE INSTALLATION METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE PRIOR REPAIR, THE DESIGN OF THE REPAIR (I.E., USE OF A LONGITUDINAL FILET WELD AND BOLT-ON-CLAMP VS TYPE B PRESSURE CONTAINING SLEEVE) AND FATIGUE OF THE WELD DUE TO PRESSURE CYCLING ON LINE 27.",11808.0,1.0,1111.0,51.93519351935193,1.0,0.0,0.0,15.739999999999998,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DAMAGE TO THE SEALS AND O-RINGS ALLOWED ETHYLENE TO LEAK INTO THE BORE OF THE GLAND PLATE. THERMAL DECOMPOSITION OF ETHYLENE IN THE THERMAL SEAL REGION LED TO A FIRE SURROUNDING THE PUMP.      THIS ACCIDENT REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION AND ALL DATA IS NOT YET AVAILABLE TO BOARDWALK.  A SUPPLEMENT REPORT WILL FOLLOW AS ADDITIONAL DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE.    5-29-19 PER PHMSA MARK-UP OF ORIGINAL ACCIDENT REPORT TO TELL A STORY:  ON JANUARY 24, 2019 BOARDWALK LOUISIANA MIDSTREAM (BLM) OPERATIONS HAD GA-3140 C PUMP DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE. BLM UTILIZED A CONTRACTOR TO REPLACE BOTH THE INBOARD AND OUTBOARD SEALS ON THE ETHYLENE PUMP.  ONCE THE SEALS WERE REPLACED, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL COMMISSIONED THE EQUIPMENT.  BLM AND CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WERE PRESENT WHEN PUMP WAS RESTARTED. TERMINAL CONSOLE SUPPLIED START COMMEND TO PUMP. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PUMP WAS STARTED, SEAL ALARMS BECAME PRESENT ON THE CONSOLE. OPERATIONS TECH CALLED CONTROL ROOM TO SHUT OWN THE PUMP BECAUSE IT HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE. THE PUMP EXPERIENCED AN ESD DUE TO VIBRATIONS BEFORE THE CONSOLE COULD SHUT IT DOWN.    OPERATIONS BEGAN ISOLATING THE WHOLE PUMP HEADER AND BEGAN SENDING ETHYLENE TO FLARE ON THE PROCESS PIPING. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ALSO POINTED THE FRESHWATER FIRE MONITORS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PUMP. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED AND THEY EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE. THE FAILURE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY ETHYLENE BEING RELEASED AND IGNITED DUE TO IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE DRIVE-END MECHANICAL SEAL BY THE CONTRACTOR.    12-10-19 UPDATED TO CORRECT RESPONSE TO PART D QUESTION 3 (NO LONG TERM IMPACT ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED OR IS PLANNED).

IN PREPARATION FOR THAT PROJECT A CREW WAS HAND EXCAVATING THE VALVE ON FEBRUARY 5TH TO LOCATE THE WELD AND CONCRETE SUPPORTS.  WHILE BACKFILLING THE EXCAVATION BY HAND, A SMALL GAS LEAK WAS HEARD AND A STOP WORK WAS CALLED. INVESTIGATION OF THE GAS LEAK IDENTIFIED THAT THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM A SMALL CRACK ON A FITTING CONNECTED TO THE BODY DRAIN VALVE.  IT WAS KNOWN THAT IF THE PRESSURE COULD BE RELIEVED FROM THE VALVE BODY, THE LEAK WOULD BE STOPPED.     FEBRUARY 5TH - 6TH: SEVERAL EFFORTS WERE MADE TO STOP THE LEAK BUT THOSE EFFORTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.    FEBRUARY 7TH: DUE TO THE INABILITY TO STOP THE LEAK BY BLOWING DOWN THE VALVE BODY, THE ONLY OTHER OPTION TO STOP THE LEAK WAS TO REMOVE THE PRESSURE FROM THE PIPELINE.  DUE TO THE LEAK BEING LOCATED ON A MAINLINE BLOCK VALVE, ONE SECTION OF THE PIPELINE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM HAD TO BE ISOLATED TO RELIEVE PRESSURE.  OPERATIONS AND PROJECT PERSONNEL INVESTIGATED OPTIONS TO ACCELERATE VALVE REPLACEMENT OR REPAIRS. AFTER CONSIDERING ALL ALTERNATIVES THE $50,000 THRESHOLD WAS GOING TO BE EXCEEDED AND THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED.    FEBRUARY 10TH: THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED AND DECOMPRESSION STARTED TO AVOID BLOWING DOWN  ~26MMSCF IN GAS.

THIS ALARM ALSO TRIGGERED THE AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN OF THE RALSTON PUMP STATION AT 12:30 AM CST AND THE HARDY PUMP STATION AT 12:32 AM CST. ANOTHER ALARM OCCURRED AT 12:35 AM CST. OSAGE PERSONNEL BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE ALARMS AND CONTACTED THE UPSTREAM OPERATOR AS PART OF THIS EFFORT. OSAGE RESTARTED ITS MAINLINE PUMP AT CUSHING AT 12:40 AM CST (THE RALSTON AND HARDY STATIONS REMAINED OFFLINE), AND RECEIVED ANOTHER ALARM. OSAGE THEN SHUT DOWN THE MAINLINE PUMP AT CUSHING AT 12:43 AM CST AND BEGAN CLOSING IN VALVES.     OSAGE LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND ARRIVED ON-SITE AT APPX. 2:16 AM CST. THESE PERSONNEL DID NOT IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY ANY SIGNS OF A RELEASE. PERSONNEL THEN BEGAN TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE BY MOVING ALONG THE ROW WHEN, AT APPX. 3:26 AM CST, THEY IDENTIFIED SIGNS OF HEAVY HYDROCARBON ON THE GROUND AS WELL AS OVERSPRAY ON PIPELINE MARKERS. PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY MADE CONTACT BACK TO THE ARTESIA CONTROL ROOM AND THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR. OSAGE ALSO MADE INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS TO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT, R/EHS TEAM MEMBERS AS WELL AS OSROS. OSAGE THEN DISPATCHED OTHER LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL AND EMERGENCY RESOURCES, AND ACTIVATED CORPORATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SUPPORT PERSONNEL.    OSAGE MADE IMMEDIATE, EXTERNAL AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NRC AND ODEQ AT APPX. 4:05 AM CST. AT APPX. 5:59 CST, LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE. BASED OFF INITIAL DATA TRENDS, CALCULATIONS AND ON-SITE VISUAL OBSERVATION, THERE WAS AN ESTIMATED 5,769 BBLS OF CRUDE RELEASED.    UPDATE ON 03/30/2023: FOLLOWING FURTHER INVESTIGATION, OSAGE NOW ESTIMATES 7,110 BBLS OF CRUDE WERE RELEASED. TO NOTE, THE METHOD USED TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF BARRELS RELEASED HAS A +/- ERROR RATE OF 7%, OR APPROXIMATELY 487 BARRELS. IF OSAGE DETERMINES THIS NUMBER SHOULD BE CHANGED, OSAGE WILL FILE A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. INITIAL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES OCCURRED UP TO 7/12/2022 AND THEN SHIFTED TO ON-GOING, BULK RECOVERY AND REPAIRS NEEDED FOR PIPELINE RESTART, WHICH OCCURRED ON 7/18/2022.    OSAGE HAS DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF RELEASE TO BE STACKED HOOK CRACKS PRESENT IN THE PIPE AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE THAT GREW OVER TIME DUE TO PRESSURE CYCLE INDUCED FATIGUE.    UPDATE ON 8/17/23: BECAUSE THE ACCIDENT REPORT REQUIRES A NUMERICAL VALUE IN SEC. A9, AND PHMSA HAS DIRECTED OSAGE TO INSERT A VALUE, OSAGE HAS ENTERED '6,567.12' WHICH IS AN ESTIMATED MINIMUM VALUE.  TO NOTE, BASED ON ITS DATA, OSAGE BELIEVES THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE ESTIMATED 7,110 BARRELS RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.   THE MAJORITY OF CRUDE OIL RECOVERED WAS STORED IN A TANK (PLAINS T-500), WHICH ALSO CONTAINED WATER, AND THE TWO SUBSTANCES CANNOT BE MEASURED SEPARATELY.   THE ESTIMATED MINIMUM VALUE PROVIDED IN SEC. A9 IS DERIVED FROM SUBTRACTING THE T-500 OPENING VOLUME (10,231.88 BARRELS) FROM THE T-500 CLOSING VOLUME 16,799 BARRELS (WHICH IS NET OF 20% ESTIMATED WATER CONTENT).   OTHER UNKNOWN AMOUNTS OF RECOVERED CRUDE OIL WERE DISPOSED IN AN UIC WELL (ENTRAINED IN DISPOSED WATER), IN A LANDFILL (WITH INVESTIGATION-DERIVED WASTE, PPE, ABSORBENT BOOMS, ETC.), REMAINED IN FRAC TANKS USED TO STORE WATER FOR DISPOSAL IN THE UIC WELL, AND SOME PRODUCT MAY HAVE ALSO EVAPORATED.  LASTLY, CERTAIN SMALL AMOUNTS OF CRUDE OIL MAY REMAIN IN SOIL AND SEDIMENT AT THE SITE AND ARE SUBJECT TO AN ON-GOING ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD INVESTIGATION.   FOR THESE REASONS, OSAGE IS PROVIDING A MINIMUM ESTIMATED VOLUME OF COMMODITY RECOVERED AS 6,567.12. BUT BELIEVES THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE 7,110 ESTIMATED AS RELEASED HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.",17355.0,0.0,1080.0,80.27777777777779,1.0,1.0,0.0,28.46,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE SUPPLY GAS REGULATOR FROZE OFF WHICH RESULTED IN THE SUPPLY GAS SYSTEM PRESSURE DROPPING TO 0 PSIG.  THE LOSS OF PRESSURE TO THE SUPPLY GAS SYSTEM CAUSED THE ESD BLOW DOWN VALVES TO OPEN AS DESIGNED AND VENT NATURAL GAS TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  THE NATURAL GAS WAS VENTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 54 MINUTES UNTIL PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO REACH THE SITE AND RESTORE NORMAL OPERATION.  DURING A FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATION, A SMALL LEAK WAS FOUND ON A 3/8"" TUBING UNION DOWNSTREAM OF THE SUPPLY GAS REGULATOR WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED GAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE SUPPLY GAS REGULATOR.  THE FLOWING CONDITIONS THROUGH THE SUPPLY GAS REGULATOR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OF -30 DEGF WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE SUPPLY GAS REGULATOR TO FREEZE OFF WITH SUBSEQUENT LEAKING THROUGH THE TUBING UNION CAUSING THE LOSS OF PRESSURE TO THE SUPPLY GAS SYSTEM.      THE LEAK IN THE 3/8"" TUBING UNION HAS BEEN FIXED; AND HEAT TRACE AND AN INSULATION BLANKET HAVE BEEN INSTALLED ON THE SUPPLY GAS REGULATOR TO PREVENT THIS SITUATION FROM REOCCURRING.

THE LEAK WAS FROM A GASKET IN AN ISOLATION POINT ON THE LIVE SIDE OF A 3"" LINE USED TO TRANSFER PRODUCT BACK INTO THE PROCESS FROM THE BREAKOUT TANKS.  THE LEAK WAS ISOLATED AND PREPARATIONS FOR REPAIRS BEGAN AT 7:05AM WITH A CALL FOR THE PARTS AND REQUEST FOR MORE PERSONNEL.  THE FLUID WAS PULLED DOWN ON THE ISOLATED SEGMENT AND THE GASKET AND VALVE WERE REPLACED WITH NEW.  CONTROL CENTER WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE REPAIRS WERE MADE AND THAT THEY COULD RETURN TO SERVICE.  AT 9:35AM THE PIPELINE WAS BACK ON LINE AND REPAIRS WERE CONFIRMED.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THERE WAS HEAVY RAIN AND SLEET WITH HIGH WINDS.  OIL ABSORBING PADS WERE PLACED AROUND THE EDGES OF THE WATER PUDDLES IN ORDER TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE SHEEN.  DUE TO THE ACCUMULATED RAIN WATER, THE SHEEN SPREAD OUT TO COVER AN AREA APPROX. 25' LONG BY 2' TO 3' WIDE BEING ROUGHLY 1/4"" DEEP.

Q: IS ENERGY XXI INVESTIGATION COMPLETE?   A: YES, THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.    Q: REPORT STATED THAT A VALVE WAS LEFT OPEN BY CONTRACT PERSONNEL.   A: ALL EXXI PIPELINE OPERATORS ARE CONTRACTORS AND THE OPERATOR IN QUESTION HAS BEEN WORKING SINCE MAY 7TH, 2014 WITH NO OTHER INCIDENTS OF OPERATOR ERROR. HYDROCARBON SAMPLES ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE DOT BREAKOUT TANKS TYPICALLY (4) TIMES IN A 24 HOUR PERIOD. THIS SAMPLING IS ONE OF THE OPERATORS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES. HYDROCARBONS ARE SOLD FROM THIS LOCATION AND THE OPERATOR SAMPLING OF BASIC SEDIMENT AND WATER IS ROUTINE.     Q: HOW DID EXXI ENSURE THAT THIS WILL NOT OCCUR AGAIN?   A: EXXI HAS PROVIDED ALL SUPERVISORS, OPERATORS, AND TECHNICIANS WITH ONSITE TRAINING THAT OCCURS INDIVIDUALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ASSOCIATING WITH THE SAMPLING OF BASIC SEDIMENT AND WATER. THE LAST TRAINING OCCURRED IN OCTOBER 2015 AND THE NEXT SCHEDULED TRAINING IS OCTOBER 2016.       ADDITIONALLY, EXXI HAS ENHANCED THE PROCESS BY INSTALLING BULL PLUGS IN THE VALVE AFTER COLLECTING BASIC SEDIMENT AND WATER SAMPLES.     Q: ARE THERE PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT GOVERN THE INSPECTION OF THIS VALVE?   A: THIS ACCIDENT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATOR NOT CLOSING A HALF INCH BALL VALVE AFTER EXTRACTING A HYDROCARBON SAMPLE. THIS ACCIDENT WAS NOT THE RESULT OF AN IMPROPER INSPECTION OF THIS VALVE.     Q: WERE THESE PROCEDURES GIVEN TO THE CONTRACTOR?   A: YES, AND REVIEWED ANNUALLY.    ALSO, AFTER THE ACCIDENT THE OPERATOR IN QUESTION WAS SUBMITTED TO D&A TESTING WITHIN THE TIME GUIDELINES OF PHMSA. THE RESULTS OF THE TESTING WAS NEGATIVE.

THE INCIDENT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH §191.15. UPON SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO TRANSMISSION LINES FAILED DURING THIS INCIDENT AND AS SUCH, IT SHOULD BE REPORTED A GAS DISTRIBUTION INCIDENT REPORT.     SUMMARY:  IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF OCTOBER 9, 2017, MULTIPLE WILDFIRES WERE REPORTED AS PART OF THE OCTOBER 2017 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. PG&E FIRST RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE GAS PIPELINE INVOLVEMENT AT 0729 HOURS WHEN IT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF GAS IGNITIONS NEAR 8537 AND 8531 SONOMA HIGHWAY IN THE CITY OF KENWOOD, SONOMA COUNTY.  PG&E'S GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) ARRIVED ON-SITE AT 0810 HOURS AND OBSERVED GAS HAD IGNITED FROM THE RISER AFTER THE METER HAD MELTED AWAY. THIS SERVICE RISER IS FED FROM A HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR (HPR) OFF OF DISTRIBUTION FEEDER MAIN (DFM) 1305-01, WHICH IS FED FROM TRANSMISSION LINE L-21 LINE SERIES. ON 10/9/17 AT 1011 HOURS THIS GAS RELEASE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE DOT (1192712) AND CPUC (171009-8550). PER 191.5(C), PG&E PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE DOT (1192859) ON 10/10/17.    FOLLOWING THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION DESCRIBED ABOVE, PG&E RECEIVED OTHER REPORTS OF HPRS AND CUSTOMER METER SETS/RISERS IN MULTIPLE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LOCATIONS AFFECTED BY THE WILDFIRES. IN RESPONSE, PG&E ACTIVATED THE LOCAL OEC, GEC AND EOC PER THE COMPANY'S GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN. PG&E CREWS WERE DEPLOYED TO ASSESS, MAKE-SAFE, AND IF POSSIBLE, REPAIR GAS FACILITIES. ON 10/9/17, AT 2011 HOURS, L-21E WAS ISOLATED AND GAS WAS VENTED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE GAS RELEASES MET THE CRITERIA OF A REPORTABLE INCIDENT UNDER BOTH THE DOT CRITERIA OF RELEASE OF GAS WITH PROPERTY DAMAGE IN EXCESS OF $50,000, AS WELL AS THE CPUC CRITERIA OF BOTH PROPERTY DAMAGE AND HAVING ATTRACTED PUBLIC ATTENTION. THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF INJURIES OR FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PG&E GAS FACILITIES. IN TOTAL, APPROXIMATELY 42,500 GAS CUSTOMERS WERE ISOLATED IN THE AREAS IMPACTED BY THE OCTOBER 2017 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES.    ON 10/12/17, AT 1700 HOURS, L-21E WAS RESTORED. BY 10/19/17, ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMERS WHOSE PROPERTY COULD ACCEPT GAS SERVICE WERE RESTORED OR HAD RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE ATTEMPTED RELIGHT.  ESTIMATED DAMAGE COST CALCULATIONS ARE ONGOING DUE TO THE LARGE SCALE NATURE OF THE WILDFIRES AND TOTAL COMPANY COSTS ARE NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME. THE NUMBERS PROVIDED HEREIN ARE FOR ESTIMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE THE BEST ESTIMATE AT THE TIME OF COMPLETING THIS REPORT.

ALL ABOVE GROUND PIPING AND EQUIPMENT WAS IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATED AT THE SITE AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND.  VNG CALLED IN A MISS UTILITY LOCATE TICKET TO EXCAVATE IN THE AREA TO SEARCH FOR THE POTENTIAL LEAK.  THE TICKET WAS CLEARED AND EXCAVATION BEGAN ON 01/23/12.  A SMALL LEAK WAS FOUND AT THE 24 INCH WELD-END INSULATOR THAT WAS NEAR THE LADYSMITH M&R STATION.

AT 21:52, OPERATIONS CONTROL RECEIVED A CALL FROM A 3RD PARTY REPORTING A FIRE AT THE HENRIETTA PUMP STATION. A CODE RED EVENT WAS INITIATED AND THE HENRIETTA FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ONSITE AND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE. A DE MINIMUS VOLUME OF PRODUCT WAS RELEASED AND THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS THAT PRODUCT REACHED THE GROUND.  AN INCIDENT INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED AND DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO BE A FAILURE WITH THE RUN RELAY. THE RUN STATUS IN THE PLC WAS A REFLECTION OF THE RUN CONTROL OUTPUT STATUS. A STOP COMMAND FROM THE CONTROLLER CAUSED THE RUN RELAY OUTPUT TO DROP OUT, HOWEVER, THE RUN RELAY FAILED AND WELDED IN THE CLOSED POSITION. THIS CAUSED THE MOTOR STARTER TO NOT RESPOND TO THE STOP COMMAND FROM THE PLC SYSTEM.  THE SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES ON THE UNIT CLOSED AS EXPECTED DURING THE SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE.  THE UNIT CONTINUED TO OPERATE AGAINST THE CLOSED VALVES, INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PRODUCT, WHICH ULTIMATELY CAUSED THE INBOARD MECHANICAL SEAL TO FAIL. TO PREVENT FUTURE OCCURRENCE, THE RUN AND STOP RELAY OUTPUTS FROM THE MAINLINE STARTER WILL BE SEPARATED. ADDITIONALLY, EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN RELAYS WILL BE INSTALLED AND WIRED DIRECTLY INTO THE CIRCUIT BREAKER FEEDING THE MOTOR STARTER FOR ALL ACTIVE STATIONS ON THE ORION PIPELINE SYSTEM.

HOWEVER, IT COULD NOT BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DAMAGE MEETS THE THREE CRITERIA REQUIRED TO VALIDATE MIC.    IN ADDITION TO COMPREHENSIVE METALLURGICAL TESTING, CONSUMERS ENERGY CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE 2005 TOOL DATA AND IDENTIFIED TWO DIG LOCATIONS AS VERIFICATION. THE LOCATIONS, DIG #1 JT 60 AND DIG #2 JT 117,  WERE EXPOSED, EXAMINED AND ONE SECTION (DIG #2 JT 117) WAS REPLACED DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF MINOR CORROSION.  ULTRASONIC THICKNESS (UT) SENSORS WERE ALSO INSTALLED AT THESE TWO LOCATION TO MONITOR INTERNAL CORROSION.  REMEDIATION WORK WAS COMPLETED AND LATERAL 60 WEST WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON OCTOBER 7, 2016.    ON OCTOBER 24, 2015 AN ADDITIONAL LEAK WAS DISCOVERED ON LATERAL 60 WEST APPROXIMATELY 677 FEET NORTH OF THE LEAK IDENTIFIED IN MAY.  AN INCIDENT REPORT-GAS TRANSMISSION AND GATHERING PIPELINE SYSTEMS (2015140-16931) WAS SUBMITTED TO PHMSA ON NOVEMBER 24, 2015.    LABORATORY ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE LEAK DISCOVERED IN OCTOBER WAS A RESULT OF A LOCALIZED CORROSION PIT ON THE PIPE ID.

THE FAILURE WAS AT AN ORIGINAL ACETYLENE GIRTH WELD COMPLETED IN 1947. THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A LAB FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED ON 12/18/2020 (NRC # 1294597). A 48 HR FOLLOW UP CALL WAS PROVIDED TO THE NRC ON  12/20/2020 (NRC # 1294630).   AT TIME OF REPORT SUBMISSION, ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS HAS NOT YET RECEIVED THE RESULTS OF THE LAB ANALYSIS. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE REPORT IS COMPLETED.    03.15.2021 UPDATE    ON DECEMBER 18TH, 2020 AT 15:22 ENABLE GAS TRANSMISSION SYSTEM CONTROL DETECTED LOSS OF PRESSURE VIA SCADA FOR LINE A-SOUTH IN CADDO PARISH LOUISIANA. LOCAL OPERATIONS WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO LOCATE THE FAILURE. ENABLE RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDER AT 16:02 NOTIFYING THEM OF THE EXACT FAILURE LOCATION. THE FAILURE WAS FOUND BY LOCAL PUBLIC WHO NOTIFIED THE LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDER. ENABLE OPERATIONS WERE ONSITE AT 16:40.   THE FAILED SECTION WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A LAB FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE LAB RESULTS PERFORMED ON THE SUBMITTED FRACTURED GIRTH WELD INDICATE THAT THE CAUSE OF FAILURE IS RELATED TO A TENSILE LOAD ACTING ON THE GIRTH WELD THAT HAD HOT CRACKING PRESENT IN THE ROOT AND CAP WELD METAL.   THE INITIATION OF THE FRACTURE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE GIRTH WELD DUE TO THE REDUCED EFFECTIVE WALL THICKNESS IN THE GIRTH WELD METAL CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF HOT CRACKING AND STRESS RISERS CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF HOT CRACKING.  THE TENSILE LOAD IS PRESUMED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTRUCTION THAT OCCURRED ON A-SOUTH IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FAILED GIRTH WELD IN JUNE OF 2020. THE JUNE 2020 JOB CONSISTED OF INSTALLING 88 FEET OF PIPE TO REMEDIATE DRESSER COUPLES (DC) ON THE LINE. TO HELP STABILIZE THE LEGACY PIPE, 3 SLEEVES WERE INSTALLED UPSTREAM AND 3 SLEEVES WERE INSTALLED DOWNSTREAM ON ACETYLENE GIRTH WELDS (AGW) AND DC PRIOR TO THE NEW CONSTRUCTION. THE FAILURE LOCATION WAS A MISSED GIRTH WELD (FIRST ACETYLENE WELD DOWNSTREAM OF REPLACEMENT) WHICH WAS NOT IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO AND DURING CONSTRUCTION.    TO INCREASE PIPE STABILITY THE STANDARD PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO INSTALL SLEEVES WHEN AGW ARE EXPOSED AND PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION. THE 88-FOOT REPLACEMENT WAS PERFORMED IN JUNE 2020. THE SLEEVES WERE INSTALLED IN FEBRUARY OF 2020 IN ADVANCE OF THE PIPE REPLACEMENT PROJECT. THE PROCESS TO EXPOSE A GIRTH WELD IS TO REMOVE AS LITTLE DIRT AS POSSIBLE (TO LIMIT STRESS ON PIPE WHILE PRESSURIZED) UNTIL A AGW IS DISCOVERED AND A SLEEVE CAN BE INSTALLED. GOING FORWARD, ENABLE WILL UPDATE THEIR DC AND AGW PROCEDURES TO INCLUDE THE PRACTICE OF REMOVING ALL DIRT (WHILE THE PIPELINE SEGMENT IS FULLY EVACUATED) FROM THE LEGACY PIPE CUTOUT TO THE FIRST GIRTH WELD UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM. THIS WILL ENSURE THE FIRST JOINT HAS NOT BEEN MISSED AND HAS THE REQUIRED INSTALLED SLEEVE PRIOR TO THE PIPE BEING RE-PRESSURIZED.    03.15.2021 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT  C.3E CHANGED TO SEAMLESS  D.7D ADDED $27,000  G.2 ADDED HOT CRACKING  H.

AS OF 11/24/2015, BASED ON THE WORK PERFORMED BY OUR INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY CONSULTANT (I.E. THE 'OUTSIDE EXPERT' MENTIONED ABOVE), OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SPILL VOLUME IS 2,934 BARRELS.    THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PIPELINE SEGMENT INDICATE THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT AN AREA OF WALL THINNING FROM EXTERNAL CORROSION THAT ULTIMATELY FAILED BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD UNDER THE IMPOSED OPERATING PRESSURE. THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE EXTERNAL CORROSION OBSERVED ON THE PIPE SECTION IS CONSISTENT WITH CORROSION UNDER INSULATION FACILITATED BY WET-DRY CYCLING.

METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CORRODED AREAS WILL DETERMINE THE ACTUAL TYPE AND CAUSE OF THE CORROSION. (SEE BELOW)    THE INITIAL CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE CARBON STEEL BOLTS THAT ARE CONNECTED BETWEEN THE PROVER PIPING AND THE SWITCH ADAPTER BLOCK. THE SWITCH ADAPTER BLOCK WAS CONSTRUCTED OF STAINLESS STEEL. THE COMBINING OF DISSIMILAR METALS IN AN ELECTROLYTE, STAINLESS STEEL TO CARBON STEEL, MAY HAVE CREATED A LOCALIZED GALVANIC CELL. THE MECHANICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CARBON STEEL PROVER PIPING AND CARBON STEEL BOLTS MAY HAVE DEVELOPED DISCONTINUITY OVER TIME. AS THE CARBON STEEL BOLTS BECAME MORE ANODIC TO THE STAINLESS STEEL PLATE, THE RESISTANCE OF THE CARBON STEEL MECHANICAL CONNECTIONS MAY HAVE INCREASED.

THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE ON BCSC LINE 4 FROM AN ABOVEGROUND 3-INCH PIPELINE CONNECTING A METER STATION IN THE AREA TO STORAGE WELL 12-3 (OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A ""WELL LEAD"").     FOLLOWING AN INVESTIGATION, PRELIMINARY FINDINGS POINTED TO LOSS OF INTERNAL PIPE WALL THICKNESS IN THE 3-INCH PIPE CAUSED THE PIPE TO RUPTURE AND BREAK APART. SAMPLES OF THE PIPE WERE SUBMITTED FOR METALLURGICAL TESTING AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE WAS DUE TO EROSION (AS INDICATED IN PART G1).     DURING THE NATURAL GAS RELEASE BETWEEN 0.7 AND 0.9 BARRELS OF LIQUIDS, CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF WATER AND DISTILLATE, WERE ALSO RELEASED UNDER HIGH PRESSURE.  DUE TO THE HIGH PRESSURE OF THE RELEASE, THE LIQUIDS WERE RELEASED IN A BROAD AREA ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE. THE SURFACE OF THIS ENTIRE AREA WAS TREATED WITH BIO-AMENDMENTS.

THE ISOLATION VALVE IN THE INCOMING TANK SUPPLY LINE WAS CLOSED, TAGGED AND LOCKED OUT.  THE BREAKER TO THE MIXER MOTOR WAS ALSO OPENED, TAGGED AND LOCKED OUT. THE CREW ALSO COMPLETED A WORK AUTHORIZATION PERMIT AS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THIS TASK.      THE CREW BEGAN REMOVING THE EXISTING MIXER.  IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE OLD MIXER FROM THE TANK, A ONE TON DIESEL POWERED MECHANIC'S TRUCK WAS BACKED APPROXIMATELY 18-INCHES FROM THE MIXER IN ORDER TO USE THE CRANE MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK TO LIFT THE MIXERS.  PRIOR TO POSITIONING THE TRUCK NEAR THE MIXER, A VOC SURVEY OF THE WORK AREA INDICATED NO PRESENCE OF A HAZARDOUS ATMOSPHERE.  THE TRUCK WAS LEFT RUNNING WHEN REMOVAL OF THE MIXER FROM THE TANK BEGAN.  WHEN THE MIXER WAS PULLED FROM THE MAN WAY MOUNTING FLANGE OF THE TANK, VOC VAPORS EMANATED FROM THE TANK AND ENVELOPED THE WORK AREA, INCLUDING THE MECHANIC'S TRUCK.  AT THE TIME THE MIXER MOVED FROM THE MAN WAY FLANGE, THE GAS MONITOR WORN BY ONE OF THE WORKERS ALARMED.  THE WORKER STEPPED BACK FROM THE MAN WAY UNTIL THE ALARM CLEARED.  THE MECHANIC'S TRUCK ALSO BEGAN TO BACK FIRE, RACE, AND SURGE OUT OF CONTROL FROM THE HYDROCARBON RICH ATMOSPHERE.  THE TRUCK'S IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF BUT THE TRUCK CONTINUED TO RUN.  FEARFUL FOR THEIR SAFETY, THE THREE EMPLOYEES FLED FROM THE AREA.  JUST AS THE EMPLOYEES FLED, THE HYDROCARBON VAPOR CLOUD FLASHED FROM THE TRUCK IGNITION SOURCE CAUSING AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE.  THE EXPLOSION RESULTED IN THE TANK AND TRUCK BEING SET ON FIRE.      THE JAL, NEW MEXICO VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS IMMEDIATELY CALLED BY ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT.  THE JAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS FIRST TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDENT AND THE EUNICE, N. MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED A SHORT TIME LATER.  THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED AT 1110MST.      TWO EMPLOYEES WERE TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO WINKLER COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL FOR PRECAUTIONARY MEDICAL EVALUATIONS.  ONE EMPLOYEE SUFFERED A SECOND DEGREE BURN AND BLISTERING TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND A SECOND EMPLOYEE SUFFERED MINOR BRUISING FROM BEING KNOCKED TO THE GROUND BY THE EXPLOSION.  AFTER RECEIVING MEDICAL EVALUATIONS, THE TWO EMPLOYEES WERE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO WORK.    UPON DETERMINING THE STATUS OF THE INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCIDENT, A TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (1043 MST) AND WAS ASSIGNED NRC REPORT NO.  997554.    AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS A RESULT OF FLAMMABLE VAPORS REACHING A SOURCE OF IGNITION DURING THE REPLACEMENT OF A TANK MIXER.  THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS DUE TO OPERATOR PERSONNEL FAILING TO FOLLOW REQUIRED MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY PROCEDURES AND POLICIES WHEN PERFORMING WORK WITHIN AN AREA WITH A POTENTIAL HAZARDOUS ATMOSPHERE.      THE FIRE DESTROYED THE PICKUP AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE TANK INCLUDING DISTORTION OF A PORTION OF THE OUTER SHELL AND THE INTERNAL FLOATING ROOF AND HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR PAINT AND THE OLD MIXER THAT WAS REMOVED.  THE DAMAGED TANK WILL BE DEMOLISHED AND AN EXISTING TANK AT JAL STATION WILL BE USED TO PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF THE DEMOLISHED TANK.    TO PREVENT THIS FROM REOCCURRING, PLAINS IS ENHANCING THE CURRENT TRAINING OF THE WORK AUTHORIZATION PERMIT TO INCLUDE STRONG EMPHASIS ON PROCEDURES FOR ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL IGNITION SOURCES IN WORK AREAS.  IN ADDITION, DURING FUTURE WORK, ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH A CALIBRATED DIRECT READING INSTRUMENT INITIALLY AND CONTINUOUS MONITORING WILL BE PERFORMED AND DOCUMENTED.

THE BULKHEAD CONSTRUCTION WOULD INVOLVE ADDING 5' OF COVER OVER ENTERPRISE'S LINE 219.  THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH ORION PERSONNEL IN JUNE AND JULY 2020, ENTERPRISE WAS TOLD THE DREDGING ACTIVITIES IN THE CHANNEL WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 60' OFF THE SHORELINE.    ON 7/16/20, ENTERPRISE AND ORION PERSONNEL MET AT THE WORKSITE.  WHEN THE GROUP ARRIVED, CANE POLES INSTALLED IN 2019 TO MARK LINE 219 WERE STILL PRESENT IN THE WATER.  ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT SCOPE OF WORK DIDN'T INVOLVE DREDGING WITHIN 50' OF LINE 219, ENTERPRISE MARKED LINE 219 AS A COURTESY BECAUSE ORION MAY NEED TO PLACE AN ANCHOR IN THE VICINITY OF LINE 219.  ENTERPRISE LOCATED AND MARKED LINE 219 ON THE SHORELINE AND, FOR THE PORTIONS OF LINE 219 IN THE WATER, ENTERPRISE SUPPLEMENTED THE EXISTING CANE POLES WITH CANE POLES PROVIDED BY ORION. THE CANE POLES WERE PLACED ~5' TO ~10' AWAY FROM LINE 219 (CLOSER TO THE WORK AREA) TO PROVIDE A ""BUFFER"" BETWEEN THE WORK AREA AND LINE 219.  DURING THIS MEETING, ORION CONFIRMED THAT NO WORK WOULD BE PERFORMED NEAR LINE 219, AND ENTERPRISE INSTRUCTED ORION TO CONTACT THEM IF THERE WERE ANY CHANGES IN THE PLANS.  ON 8/21/20 AT 8:02 AM, ENTERPRISE'S CONTROLLER RECEIVED AN ALARM INDICATING LOW PRESSURE AT VIOLA STATION.  AT 8:05 AM, THE CONTROL VALVE AT VIOLA STATION, LOCATED DOWNSTREAM OF METER 1004, AUTOMATICALLY CLOSED.  AT ~8:07 AM, THE VIOLA METER REGISTERED NO FLOW ON THE PIPELINE.  AT 8:09 AM, ENTERPRISE CONTROLLER CALLED LOCAL OPERATIONS TECHNICIANS TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF PRESSURE.  BETWEEN ~8:30 AM AND ~8:45 AM, OPERATIONS TECHNICIANS ARRIVED AT VIOLA STATION (UPSTREAM OF THE INCIDENT SITE) AND ORIGIN STATION (DOWNSTREAM OF THE INCIDENT SITE) TO MANUALLY CLOSE VALVES AT BOTH LOCATIONS TO ISOLATE THE PIPELINE. AT 9:05 AM, VALVES AT CANTWELL STATION (UPSTREAM OF ORIGIN STATION) WERE CLOSED TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE PIPELINE.  AT 9:47 AM, PIPELINE CONTROL RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE PORT OF CORPUS CHRISTI NOTIFYING THEM THAT A DREDGING OPERATION HAD STRUCK A PIPELINE AND THERE WAS A FIRE.  AT ~9:53 AM, LOCAL ENTERPRISE OPERATIONS CONFIRMED, BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT LINE 219 WAS STRUCK BY A 3RD PARTY.   NRC WAS CALLED AT 10:12 AM AND REPORT TAKEN AT 10:52 AM.  NRC UPDATES: #1285319 (48-HR UPDATE) AND #1285505. TRRC WAS NOTIFIED AT 10:18 AM (INCIDENT #2251).  ON 8/24/20, AN UNDERWATER INSPECTION FOUND EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL DAMAGE AND TWO PUNCTURES IN THE PIPELINE.   THE DAMAGED PIPELINE WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED AND THE PIPELINE RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 10/22/20.  ENTERPRISE AND OTHER PARTIES PARTICIPATED IN THE NTSB'S INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE NTSB CONCLUDED THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS DUE TO ORION'S INADEQUATE PLANNING AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES FAILED TO IDENTIFY THE PROXIMITY OF THEIR DREDGING OPERATION TO ENTERPRISE'S PIPELINE AND RESULTED IN THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE CONTROLS TO PREVENT THE DREDGE'S CUTTERHEAD FROM STRIKING THE PIPELINE.

AT 02:59 ON 8/12/2014 SSC OPERATOR CONTACTED GAS CONTROL NOTIFYING OF A POSSIBLE LEAK ON A SSC LINE.  THE LEAK WAS AT THE I-35 AND 67TH STREET EXIT WHERE SSC AND KGS HAD LINES LOCATED.  KGS COMPLETED THEIR EXCAVATION AT 16:34 ON 8/12/2014.  KGS STATED THE GAS DETECTION WAS STRONGER AS THEY MOVED CLOSER TO THE SSC LINE .  SSC OPERATIONS BEGAN EXCAVATION AFTER THIS DETERMINATION.  SSC BEGAN BLOW-DOWN TO DETERMINE OWNERSHIP OF THE LEAK AT 19:37 ON 8/12/2014.  SSC OPERATIONS COMPLETED THE BLOWDOWN AND CONFIRMED THE LEAK AT 09:03 ON 8/13/2014.  SSC CONTINUED TO EXCAVATE THE AREA TO TRY AND DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK.  AT 16:21 ON 8/13/2014 THE PIPE WAS UNCOVERED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS BELIEVED TO BE UNDER THE I-35 ROADWAY.  AT THIS TIME THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS NOTIFIED BASED ON THE EXPECTED REPAIR COST TO EXCEED $50,000.  DUE TO LOCATION AND LACK OF WORKSPACE THIS PIPE COULD NOT BE REMOVED TO INVESTIGATE THE LEAK.  SSCGP DETERMINED THE PIPE WAS INSTALLED BY PULLING THROUGH AN HDD HOLE AND PIPE DID NOT CONTAIN ABRASION RESISTANT COATING.  THE HOLE HAD BEEN BORED THROUGH SOLID ROCK.  SSCGP BELIEVES EXTERNAL CORROSION CAUSED BY DAMAGE TO COATING DURING INSTALL, BY SCRAPING THE SIDES OF THE BORE HOLE, TO BE THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE LEAK.  SSCGP IS RESEARCHING ANY SIMILARLY INSTALLED PIPE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OTHER LEAKS CAN OCCUR AND WHAT SSCGP CAN DO TO ELIMINATE THESE POSSIBLE THREATS.  SSC HAS COMPLETED THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ROAD CROSSING BY PULLING A 16"" PIPE INTO THE EXISTING 20"" LINE.  THE EXISTING LINE WILL BE USED AS A CASING.  THE REPLACEMENT WAS COMPLETED ON 9/3/2014.

THE CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED DAMAGE TO THE GAS LINE AND THE ODOR OF GAS AT 9:59 A.M. ON JULY 29, 2021.  CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL CALLED 911 AT 9:59 AM.  WITHIN MINUTES OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST RESPONDING POLICE OFFICER, CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL INFORMED THE POLICE OFFICER THAT A GAS LINE HAD BEEN HIT.  BOTH OF THESE COMMUNICATIONS TO 911 AND TO THE POLICE OFFICER OCCURRED BEFORE CENTERPOINT WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.  PART A.14 DOES NOT PROVIDE THE OPTION TO INCLUDE THE CONTRACTOR AS HAVING PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION TO LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.  THE TIME INDICATED IN PART A.15 OF THE COMMUNICATION TO EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WAS BY THE CONTRACTOR.  THE TIME INSERTED IN PART A.4 AS THE EARLIEST LOCAL TIME THAT INCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA WAS MET WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE POSSIBILITY OF PROPERTY DAMAGES EXCEEDING THE REPORT CRITERIA AMOUNT, AT WHICH TIME CENTERPOINT DID NOT HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION.  THE INITIAL VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE SERVICE LINE AFTER THE INCIDENT AT THE SITE REVEALED THAT THE STEEL SERVICE LINE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN GOUGED AND DEFORMED BY DIRECTIONAL BORING EQUIPMENT.  THE DAMAGED SERVICE LINE PIPE WAS REMOVED FROM THE SCENE AND WAS EXAMINED AS PART OF A JOINT INSPECTION AT A METALLURGICAL LABORATORY.  THE EXAMINATION CONFIRMED THAT THE STEEL SERVICE LINE WAS GOUGED BY THE DIRECTIONAL BORE DRILL BIT ON JULY 28.  THE FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE PIPE INDICATED THAT THE BREACH OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF A SINGLE EVENT DUCTILE OVERLOAD DUE TO CONTACT BETWEEN THE PIPE AND THE EQUIPMENT USED DURING THE PULL-BACK OF THE NEWLY INSTALLED POLY PIPE ON JULY 29.  NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND TO INDICATE THAT THE STEEL SERVICE LINE LEAKED AT THE LOCATION OF THE ULTIMATE BREACH BEFORE THE DIRECTIONAL DRILLING AND PULL-BACK OPERATION.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY CORROSION OR PIPE MATERIAL DEFICIENCY THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ULTIMATE BREACH OF THE PIPE.    IN REFERENCE TO PART F QUESTION 2, ONLY 1 CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE WAS DOT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTED. WITHIN 5 HOURS OF THE INCIDENT, OPERATOR DIRECTED BOTH CONTRACTOR COMPANIES TO PERFORM DOT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING OF THEIR EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION. THE SOLE MAGNOLIA RIVER EMPLOYEE INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROPRIATE TESTING, AND THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. SUBSEQUENT TO ITS INITIAL DIRECTION TO MDR GROUP CONSTRUCTION REGARDING TESTING REQUIREMENTS, OPERATOR LEARNED THAT THE TESTING FACILITY CHOSEN BY MDR GROUP CONSTRUCTION WAS CLOSED, AND IT USED AN ALTERNATIVE FACILITY. OPERATOR LEARNED BEYOND THE TESTING WINDOW THAT THE ALTERNATIVE FACILITY DID NOT ADMINISTER ALCOHOL TESTING TO ANY OF THE MDR GROUP CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYEES DURING THE PRESCRIBED TESTING WINDOW. THE DRUG TESTS FOR THE MDR GROUP CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYEES WERE NEGATIVE.",30525.0,0.0,60.0,58.333333333333336,0.0,0.0,1.0,27.855,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE EMPLOYEE ACCESSED THE STATION DATA TO SAFELY IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE SOUND. HE OBSERVED NO PRESSURES EXCEEDING MAOP. HE THEN APPROACHED THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING AND AT 8:25 AM CONFIRMED THAT THE SOUND WAS NATURAL GAS VENTING FROM THE RELIEF VALVE (RV) ON DISCHARGE PIPING DOWNSTREAM OF COMPRESSOR NO. 80.  HE SHUT NO. 80 DOWN AND ISOLATED THE RV BY 8:30 AM STOPPING THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE REPORTED CAPACITY OF THE RV (FARRIS ENGINEERING SERIES 2600 PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE TYPE 26KC1-4-920) WAS 39,333 SCFM WITH A SET PRESSURE OF 1,100 PSIG. THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED OF THE RELEASE ON MAY 30, 2018 AT 09:19 AM.  THE TOTAL VOLUME OF THE RELEASE REPORTED WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 24,000 MCF.  AT 9:43 AM, THE RRC OF TEXAS WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.      ON APRIL 1, 2018 AT 5:52 AM, A REVISED RELEASE VOLUME (17,414 MCF) WAS REPORTED WITH THE 48-HOUR UPDATE TO THE NRC (NRC NO. 1208193).  THE VOLUME WAS BASED ON THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY, ORIFICE DIAMETER OF 3 INCHES AT 940 PSIG FOR 325 MINUTES, ASSUMING THE RELEASE BEGAN AT 3:24 AM, BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA AT THE STATION.  THIS TIME WAS SELECTED AS THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT THE INCIDENT BEGAN AND WAS BASED ON AN OBSERVED PRESSURE DROP RECORDED ON DISCHARGE PIPING FOR NO. 80 THE MORNING OF THE EVENT.  IT WOULD BE DETERMINED LATER IN THE INVESTIGATION THAT THIS OBSERVED PRESSURE DROP WAS CAUSED BY A STOP COMMAND ISSUED BY GAS CONTROL ON COMPRESSOR UNIT NO. 79; DETERMINED TO BE UNRELATED TO THE EVENT.       ON APRIL 2, 2018, THE RV WAS INSPECTED BY TEJAS AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE ANY SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE UNIT BUT THEY DID NOTICE THE UNIT CONTINUED TO LEAK GAS. ON APRIL 11, 2018, TEJAS DECIDED TO SEND THE RV TO THE SUPPLIER FOR FURTHER INSPECTION AND REPAIR. THE VENDOR REPORTED THAT THE DISC HOLDER AND SOFT RETAINER SCREW WERE FOUND TO BE DAMAGED.  AT THAT TIME, THE UNIT WAS REPAIRED WITH NEW PARTS AND ADJUSTED TO REESTABLISH THE REQUIRED SET POINT AND TESTED BY THE VENDOR. THE RV UNIT WAS REINSTALLED APRIL 16TH 2018. HOWEVER, NO.80 WAS NOT PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE UNTIL APRIL 23, 2018 AS THE UNIT WAS NOT NEEDED UNTIL THAT TIME.      ON APRIL 11, 2018, TEJAS RE-ESTIMATED THE RELEASE VOLUME USING THE ACTUAL RV SPECIFICATIONS USING THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY FOR A TOTAL DURATION OF 325 MINUTES WITH THE RELEASE BEGINNING AT 3:24 AM AND ESTIMATED THE VOLUME TO BE 13,591 MCF. THIS WAS THE VALUE REPORTED WITH THE INITIAL 30-DAY INCIDENT REPORT TO PHMSA AND THE TRRC.     ON MAY 3, 2018, THE RELEASE VOLUME WAS RE-ESTIMATED USING HOURLY GAS VOLUME MEASUREMENT DATA TO ESTABLISH AN HOURLY VOLUME LOSS THROUGH THE STATION DURING THE EVENT.  THE TOTAL RELEASE VOLUME WAS 3,920 MCF.  THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE EVENT USING THIS DATA REVEALED THE EVENT TRIGGERED A REPORTING REQUIREMENT BETWEEN 5:00 AM AND 6:00 AM AND LASTING UNTIL THE UNIT WAS ISOLATED AT 8:30 AM THAT MORNING.  THEREFORE, TEJAS CHANGED THE RESPONSE TO PART A  Q4 FROM 3:24 AM TO 5:00 AM WITH THIS REPORT. TEJAS BELIEVES THE HOURLY GAS LOSS REMAINS THE BEST ESTIMATE OF ACTUAL RELEASE VOLUME SINCE THE RV COULD NOT OPEN TO FULL CAPACITY DUE TO THE INTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE DISC PLATE AND SEAL THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO PROPERLY RESEAT. THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE RV WAS FOUND TO BE VENTING AT A PRESSURE BELOW THE ESTABLISHED SET POINT.  THE RELEASE VOLUME IS ALSO UPDATED TO REFLECT 3,920 MCF DISCUSSED ABOVE.     ON MAY 4, 2018, THE DAMAGED RV COMPONENTS WERE SENT TO AN-TECH LAB IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.  ON JUNE 29, 2018, THE RESULTS OF THEIR METALLURGICAL INVESTIGATION SHOWED THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE WAS DUE A FRACTURED DISC LOCKING SCREW WHICH PREVENTED THE DISC FROM SEALING PROPERLY AGAINST THE ASSOCIATED O-RING. THE FRACTURE MORPHOLOGY IN THE DISC LOCKING SCREW WAS TORSIONAL OVERLOAD INDICATING THE LOCKING SCREW WAS OVER TORQUED DURING ASSEMBLY; REPRESENTING THE ROOT CAUSE.",453.0,0.0,1170.0,80.34188034188034,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT IS SUPPLIED NATURAL GAS VIA PIPELINE FROM THE 9046 HANDLEY 12IN LATERAL AT THE HANDLEY 2100 YARD.     GAS CONTROL NOTIFIED OPERATIONS PERSONNEL THAT THE RELIEF VALVE ACTUATED AT APPROXIMATELY 06:45. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION AT 06:58, AND OPERATIONS MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED AT 07:03. DUE TO HAZARDOUS ROAD CONDITIONS RESPONSE TIME WAS GREATER THAN NORMAL. GAS CONTROL DID NOT CLOSE THE CONTROL VALVE AT THE SUPPLY POINT BECAUSE THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT COULD NOT BE OFFLINE DURING THE EXTREME WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS, AS IT WAS CRITICAL TO THE ELECTRIC GRID.     OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 09:00 AND THE MAINLINE BLOCK VALVE WAS CLOSED AT 09:16. ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS RELIEVED ENOUGH FOR THE RELIEF VALVE TO RE-SEAT, THEN THE MAINLINE BLOCK VALVE WAS RE-OPENED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE POWER PLANT. OPERATIONS BEGAN ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION AND DETERMINED THAT THE GAS SUPPLY LINE TUBING EXPERIENCED A FREEZE, THE FREEZE WAS IDENTIFIED, AND THE SUPPLY LINE WAS CLEARED. OPERATIONS REINSULATED THE GAS SUPPLY LINES. THE FLOW TO THE TEXGEN HANDLEY POWER PLANT AT THE HANDLEY 2100 YARD WAS NEVER FULLY INTERRUPTED.

APPARENTLY, NBPL EXPERIENCED SOME REGULATOR ISSUES THAT CAUSED FLOWS TO INCREASE AND THE PRESSURE TO EXCEED THE 830 PSIG SET POINT. NORTHERN BELIEVES NBPL EXPERIENCED TWO REGULATOR FAILURES AS THE RELIEF HAS SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO PROTECT THE 800 PSIG MAOP IN A SINGLE REGULATOR FAILURE MODE; THE PRESSURE IN THE 800 PSIG MAOP MNB91501 LINE REACHED 894 PSIG FOR A BRIEF PERIOD EXCEEDING THE MAOP PLUS ALLOWABLE BUILDUP BY 14 PSIG. CALCULATIONS INDICATE IT WOULD TAKE TWO REGULATORS TO FAIL TO REACH THIS PRESSURE WITH THE RELIEF WIDE OPEN.   MOREOVER, THE PIPELINE PRODUCES A HOOP STRESS OF 39% SMYS AT ITS 800 MAOP. THE HOOP STRESS WAS CALCULATED AS 42% AT THE OVERPRESSURE CONDITION, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE ALLOWABLE STRESS FOR PIPE IN THIS LOCATION. THIS EVENT RESULTED IN A REPORTABLE INCIDENT BECAUSE 13.9 MMCF OF NATURAL GAS WAS LOST.   ACCORDING TO 191.23(B)(2), A SRC SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED SINCE THE EVENT RESULTS IN AN INCIDENT BEFORE THE DEADLINE FOR FILING A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT.  NORTHERN BORDER PIPELINE CURRENTLY IS OPERATING ITS REGULATORS AT A REDUCED PRESSURE AND VOLUME UNTIL THE PROBABLE CAUSE CAN BE DETERMINED.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS A FAILURE OF CONTROL VALVES OWNED AND OPERATED BY NOTHERN BORDER PIPELINE COMPANY (NBPL). IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS DUE TO THE LACK OF VALVE POSITION FEEDBACK ON NBPL'S SYSTEM, AND SINCE NO DETERMINATION HAS BEEN MADE WHY THEIR PNEUMATIC BACK-UP CONTROLLERS DID NOT OVERRIDE THEIR DIGITAL CONTROL LOOP TO TAKE OVER CONTROL OF THE PRESSURE. IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT NBPL FAILED TO CONTROL PRESSURE TO THE POINT WHERE PRESSURE INCREASED TO CAUSE NORTHERN'S RELIEF VALVE TO VENT.

THE ROOT CAUSE WAS OVERPRESSURIZATION OF THE GAS SERVICE  REGULATOR SUPPLYING COOKING LOADS TO 152 APARTMENTS, DUE TO IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE VENT LINES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL INSTALLATION.  THIS WAS A PARALLEL GAS SERVICE REGULATOR INSTALLATION. PART OF THE VENT LINES WERE INSTALLED BELOW GRADE, PASSING THROUGH TWO CONCRETE BARRIERS:  ONE AT FOUNDATION WALL, AND ONE AT SIDEWALK.  THESE VENT LINES WERE BOTH UNSLEEVED, AND CORRODED OVER TIME.  WATER FROM THE SURROUNDING SOIL INFILTRATED THE VENT LINE AND COLLECTED ON TOP OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR DIAPHRAGM AND FROZE. IN ADDITION, THE VENT LINE WAS PARTIALLY FROZEN AND BLOCKED. THE SECONDARY REGULATOR SERVED TO VENT EXCESS GAS DUE TO ELEVATED PRESSURE. A SERVICE PERSON RESPONDING TO A CALL AT THIS LOCATION FOUND THE COUPLING ON THE SECONDARY VENT LINE DISCONNECTED, AND OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, ""VALVED OUT"" THE SECONDARY REGULATOR TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOWING GAS.  THIS PREVENTED THE INTERNAL RELIEF OF THE SECONDARY GAS SERVICE REGULATOR TO VENT THE EXCESS PRESSURE FROM THE FAILED REGULATOR; THEREFORE BOTH RELIEF VALVES WERE RENDERED INEFFECTIVE, ALLOWING DOWNSTREAM PRESSURE TO BUILD UP TO LEVELS BEYOND RECOMMENDED LIMITS FOR THE CUSTOMERS' EQUIPMENT AND A FIRE RESULTED IN ONE OF THE APARTMENTS.  COOKING LOADS FOR ALL 152 APARTMENTS REMAIN TURNED OFF UNTIL THE ASSIGNED PLUMBER OBTAINS THE PERMIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS.    IN PART G ABOVE, THE TASK WHICH LED TO THE INCIDENT WAS NOT A COVERED TASK FOR OUR OQ PROGRAM AT THE TIME OF THE SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION; HOWEVER, IT IS A COVERED TASK AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

THE CONTRACTOR NOTIFIED THE LEAD TECHNICIAN WHO DIRECTED THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR TO SHUT DOWN THE LINE 1 DELIVERY OPERATION. AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION REVEALED PRODUCT OVERFLOWING FROM A SUMP.  PRODUCT WAS FILLING THE SUMP BECAUSE A PROVER VENT VALVE WAS LEFT OPEN BY A TECHNICIAN AFTER FILLING THE LINE 1 PROVER EARLIER THAT DAY.  THE VALVE WAS CLOSED WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK SOURCE. INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE AND PRODUCT RECOVERY ACTIVITIES BEGAN. THE GASOLINE WAS RETAINED ONSITE AND RECOVERED IN LOW LYING AREAS OF THE STATION YARD AND FROM A STORM WATER DITCH. CONTAMINATED SOILS WERE REMOVED AND PREPPED FOR TREATMENT. AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION OF CONTROL ROOM ACTIVITIES LEADING UP TO THE EVENT DISCOVERED THAT A HIGH SUMP ALARM HAD BEEN RECEIVED AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY ONE OF THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATORS USING THE ""ACKNOWLEDGE ALL"" BUTTON DURING AN ANTICIPATED GROUP OF ALARMS.  THE GROUP OF ALARMS WAS CAUSED BY AN UNRELATED SYSTEM STARTUP OPERATION. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE HIGH SUMP ALARM WAS NOT COMMUNICATED TO THE STATION YARD OPERATOR TO RESPOND.   THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ON 1/30/15. NO OTHER NOTIFICATION OR REPORTING THRESHOLDS WERE REACHED. AN INCIDENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED WHICH REVEALED ADDITIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE EVENT. THE PROVER HAD A HISTORY OF MALFUNCTIONS INCLUDING SEQUENCING FAILURES THAT RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO THE PROVER RAM. ON THE DAY OF THE EVENT, A SERIES OF FAILED PROVING OPERATIONS OCCURRED, AND DURING AN ATTEMPTED FILL, THE TECHNICIAN RECEIVED AN INDICATION THAT THE PROVER WAS ABOUT TO OPERATE OUT OF SEQUENCE AGAIN.  THE TECHNICIAN STOPPED THE PROVER FILLING OPERATION AND LEFT TO CONFER WITH OTHERS ON A POSSIBLE SOLUTION.  THE INCIDENT ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THE TECHNICIAN'S PREOCCUPATION WITH PREVIOUS FAILURES AND BEING DISTRACTED BY THE PROVER OUT-OF-SEQUENCE INDICATIONS AS ONE THE BASIC CAUSES OF THE EVENT. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE GENERATED DURING THE IA PROCESS INCLUDING A REVIEW OF THE PROVER FILL PROCEDURE FOR ACCURACY AND USABILITY AND A REVIEW OF THE HMI ALARM SCHEME AT THE CONTROL ROOM.  THIS CONTROL ROOM REVIEW INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE ""ACKNOWLEDGE ALL"" ALARM FUNCTION WITH THE OPERATORS AND ITS INTENDED USE. A THIRD CORRECTIVE ACTION IDENTIFIED WAS THE ADDITION OF A SECONDARY OR ""MAX-FILL"" ALARM ON ALL THE STATION SUMPS.   NOTE: AT THE TIME THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT HAVE HIS OPERATOR QUALIFICATION ON COLONIAL TASK 43-4 (""MANUALLY OR REMOTELY OPEN OR CLOSE VALVES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT"") BECAUSE LOCAL PERSONNEL BELIEVED THAT VALVES OPERATED ON A PROVER DID NOT FALL WITHIN THE OQ PROGRAM.  SUBSEQUENTLY, LOCAL PERSONNEL WERE ADVISED THAT THIS TYPE OF VALVE FALLS UNDER COLONIAL'S OPERATOR QUALIFICATION PROGRAM AND THAT ONLY A QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL MAY PERFORM THE TASK.

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE 8-INCH SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE WAS OPEN WITH NO ALARM OR SHUTDOWN INDICATION.  THE 8""  SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE VENTED THE GAS INTO THE STATION BLOWDOWN SILENCER, WHICH LIMITS NOISE AND RESTRICTS FLOW VOLUME.  IN ADDITION, THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES REMAINED OPEN, AS THE STATION HAD NOT SHUT IN. THE STATION TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY SHUT IN THE STATION, WHICH WAS NOT OPERATING AT THE TIME, AND ISOLATED IT FROM THE PIPELINE BY CLOSING THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES.  GAS CONTROL WAS THEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE STATION SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE PNEUMATIC PILOT PRESSURE SWITCH HAD ACTIVATED BECAUSE WATER HAD ACCUMULATED AND FROZE IN THE SWITCH AND PILOT GAS SENSING LINES RESULTING IN A LOSS OF PRESSURE TO THE SWITCH.  THE LOSS OF PILOT GAS CAUSED THE PILOT PRESSURE SWITCH TO CHANGE STATE AND TO PNEUMATICALLY COMMAND THE BLOWDOWN VALVE TO ITS FAILSAFE POSITION, WHICH IS OPEN.

OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND WALKED THE REPORTED AREA OF CONCERN.  THE 415 LINE WAS SHUT DOWN. ALL APPLICABLE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE  A SMALL CRACK WAS DETECTED IN THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION OF A GIRTH WELD.  A TEMPORARY REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED. THE 415 LINE WILL OPERATE AT A REDUCED MOP UNTIL PERMANENT REPAIRS ARE MADE.  THESE REPAIRS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE MIDDLE OF JUNE, 2013.  TOTAL RELEASE VOLUMES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT <1BBL OF LOW SULFUR DIESEL.  NO ADDITIONAL REMEDIATION EFFORTS ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE RELEASE IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME OF THIS REPORT'S ORIGINAL SUBMITTAL.  METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON REMOVED SECTION OF PIPE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE    UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013  O THE LEAK AT THE GIRTH WELD WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A CRACK THAT INITIATED AT AN AREA OF INADEQUATE PENETRATION AND INCOMPLETE FUSION AT THE WELD ROOT, AND AT THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A REPAIR WELD AT THE LOCATION OF THE CRACK.  O THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS CRACK HAD GROWN AS A RESULT OF FATIGUE, SO IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS CRACK HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION.  O IT IS NOT EVIDENT WHAT CAUSED THE CRACK TO LEAK WHEN IT DID.  SOME FORM OF AXIAL STRESS MAY HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY (I.E. SOIL MOVEMENT, BENDING).    UPDATE FROM FINAL REPORT MARCH 14, 2014  THE LEAK IN GIRTH WELD 71+64 WAS CAUSED BY A CRACK THAT INITIATED AT AN AREA OF INADEQUATE PENETRATION (IP) AND INCOMPLETE FUSION (IF) AT THE WELD ROOT NEAR THE TOP BUTTON OF THE GIRTH WELD. THE IP AND IF DEFECTS ACTED AS STRESS CONCENTRATORS. AT THE SAME POSITION ON THE GIRTH WELD, A REPAIR WAS VISUALLY EVIDENT. REPAIRS TYPICALLY REPRESENT A STRESS CONCENTRATION BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL RESTRAINT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE WELD REPAIR CAVITY. BOTH THE BASE WELD AND REPAIR WELD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED USING THE GAS METAL ARC WELDING (GMAW) PROCESS.  THE IP AND IF DEFECTS WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CRACK HAD ENLARGED IN SERVICE (E.G. FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH), SO IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CRACK THROUGH THE REPAIR WELD WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, SOME OTHER MECHANISM MUST HAVE CAUSED THE FINAL FAILURE OF A THIN REMAINING LIGAMENT OR SOME AXIAL STRESS MUST HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY, ALLOWING PRODUCT TO ESCAPE. THE PRECISE REASON FOR THE LEAK OCCURRING WHEN IT DID IS NOT OBVIOUS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE NO REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS VISIBLE ON THE FRACTURE SURFACE, THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO WAS AN INCREASE IN THE AXIAL STRESS ACTING ON THE GIRTH WELD, SUCH AS SOIL MOVEMENT OR SETTLEMENT, WHICH CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN ENOUGH TO LEAK.",11320.332761578045,1.0,1160.0,55.68965517241379,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE PROJECT INVOLVED REPLACING A LARGE VOLUME PROVER WITH A SMALL VOLUME PROVER.  DURING THIS DRAIN UP PROCESS, THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE AT TIE-IN LOCATION #1, WAS CUT (APPROX. 2 INCHES) AS THE MEANS TO DRAIN THE ASSOCIATED PIPING WHILE VENTING WAS ATTEMPTED THROUGH A 3/8 INCH LINE ON THE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER (IN THE BOOSTER AREA APPROX. 1300FT AWAY).

A NORMAL ESD OPERATION AT THIS FACILITY WOULD NOT HAVE MET THE DOT/PHMSA REPORTABLE RELEASE VOLUME OF 3,000 MCF. AT THE TIME OF THE ESD NO UNITS AT THE STATION WERE RUNNING AND THE STATION VALVES WERE OPEN. DURING THE ESD OPERATION GAS VENTED THROUGH A 4"" BRANCH CONNECTION THROUGH A VENT VALVE.  AS PART OF OUR INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ACTUATOR ON THE STATION DISCHARGE VALVE DID NOT CLOSE COMPLETELY DUE TO LOW POWER GAS PRESSURE.  THE INCOMPLETE VALVE CLOSURE IS WHAT CAUSED THE GAS TO VENT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND EVENTUALLY SURPASSED THE REPORTABLE QUANTITY OF 3,000 MCF.      AT 18:13 KM TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE BY GAS CONTROL AND ARRIVED AT 19:06 WHERE HE VISUALLY DISCOVERED THE GAS VENTING AND CONFIRMED A FALSE FIRE ALARM. THE EMPLOYEE THEN PROCEEDED TO MANUALLY CLOSE THE DISCHARGE VALVE AT 19:20.     AN ERL CALL WAS HELD AT 19:50 WHERE THE GAS LOSS WAS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED THE REPORTING THRESHOLD. CODES AND COMPLIANCE REPORTED THIS EVENT PRIOR TO THE 1 HOUR DEADLINE FROM CONFIRMED DISCOVERY.      TOTAL GAS LOSS VOLUME WAS UNKNOWN AT THE TIME INCIDENT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED TO NRC, OPERATIONS CALCULATED THE GAS LOSS AT 10,404 MCF FOR THE 48HR NRC UPDATE.  AS PART OF OUR INVESTIGATION AFTER FURTHER REVIEW BY KINDER MORGAN MEASUREMENT SME'S THE TOTAL GAS LOSS WAS CALCULATED AT 7,663 MCF.    THE POWER GAS FOR THIS ACTUATOR COMES FROM A BURIED PRESSURE BOTTLE FED BY THE SUCTION SIDE OF THE PLANT DOWNSTREAM OF THE STATION SUCTION VALVE. NORMALLY THIS BURIED BOTTLE HAS PLENTY OF PRESSURE TO CLOSE ALL REQUIRED VALVES, BUT IN THE EVENING HOURS OF JANUARY 3RD THE MAINLINE HAD LOWER THAN NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE. WHEN THE STATION EXPERIENCED AN ESD THE PRESSURE IN THE BOTTLE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO CLOSE THE STATION DISCHARGE VALVE.    ON JANUARY 4TH EMPLOYEES RETURNED THE STATION TO SERVICE AT 07:22, INCLUDING RESTORING PRESSURE TO THE UNDERGROUND ESD STORAGE BOTTLE BY 07:45, CLEARED THE ESD ALARMS, AND TESTED THE VALVE ACTUATOR WHICH WORKED AS DESIGNED AND HAD APPROPRIATED GAS PRESSURE TO OPERATE.",11320.332761578045,0.0,894.0,62.19239373601789,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.22,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ON JUNE 20, 2018, THE PORT ARTHUR PRODUCTS JUNCTION (PAPS) FACILITY PERSONNEL WHILE CONDUCTING A ROUTINE INSPECTION OBSERVED POOLING RAINWATER AND PRODUCT (DIESEL FUEL) ON THE FLOATING ROOF OF TANK 1467.  THE POOLING RAINWATER APPEARED TO HAVE CAUSED THE ROOF TO BUCKLE, THUS, ALLOWING PRODUCT TO MIX WITH THE RAINWATER.  THE TANK IS AN EXTERNAL FLOATING ROOF DESIGN EQUIPPED WITH SPILL CHECK DEVICES ON THE DUAL ROOF DRAINS.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE TANK SPILL CHECK DEVICES HAD CLOSED WHICH IMPOUNDED THE WATER.    INITIAL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES INCLUDED REMOVING PRODUCT FROM THE TANK AT A CONTROLLED PACE.  WHILE THE TANK WAS BEING EVACUATED, PRECAUTIONARY SPILL RESPONSE CONTINGENCIES WERE PUT INTO PLACE TO ACT SHOULD A LOSS OF CONTAINMENT OCCUR AS A RESULT OF THE INITIAL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES.  SUCH CONTINGENCIES CONSISTED OF DEPLOYING CONTAINMENT BOOM BETWEEN THE TANK AND TANK DIKE WALL, MOBILIZATION OF A VACUUM TRUCK AND ON-SITE SPILL RESPONSE PERSONNEL.  AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 CDT OPERATORS BEGAN TO LOWER THE VOLUME LEVEL OF TANK 1467, WHICH WAS MONITORED CONTINUOUSLY, TO INCLUDE THE AREA AROUND THE TANK.      AT APPROXIMATELY 1645 CDT, DURING THE PROCESS OF LANDING THE FLOATING ROOF A RELEASE OF PRODUCT WAS DISCOVERED ORIGINATING FROM UNDERNEATH THE TANK.  THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED AND PRIMARILY CAPTURED WITHIN THE PREPLACED BOOMS.  INSPECTION OF THE TANK ON JUNE 25, 2018 REVEALED THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO MULTIPLE LEGS PUNCTURING THE FLOOR.  A REVIEW OF OPERATIONAL ALARM DATA INDICATED THAT THE SPILL CHECK DEVICES FAILED TO SEND AN ALARM TO THE CONTROL ROOM.  COMPREHENSIVE INCIDENT ANALYSIS IS IN PROGRESS.    REPAIR AND RECOVERY EFFORTS WERE ESTIMATED TO MEET OR EXCEED $50,000 WITH THE ESTIMATE BEING DERIVED  FROM PROPERTY DAMAGES AND SPILL RESPONSE COSTS.  A TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AT 1750 CDT (NRC REPORT NO: 1215923).  THE NRC NOTIFICATION WAS FOLLOWED BY NOTIFICATION TO THE STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (SERC).  LASTLY, COURTESY NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO PHMSA AND THE TCEQ.    THE PROPERTY DAMAGES CALCULATED EXCLUDE REPAIR COSTS OF TANK 1467 GIVEN THE TANK HAS BEEN PLACED OUT OF SERVICE.    ON JUNE 22, 2018, A 48 HOUR NOTIFICATION UPDATE WAS MADE TO THE NRC TO COMMUNICATE NO CHANGES OF INITIAL REPORTING (NRC REPORT NO: 1216135).    AS OF JUNE 25, 2018, ALL FREE PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED, WITH DISPOSAL AND TREATMENT BEING MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE REGULATIONS.  REPRESENTATIVE SOIL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED ON JUNE 28, 2018 AROUND THE TANK FOR ANALYSIS.  THE SAMPLE RESULTS YIELDED NO REQUIREMENT FOR SOIL REMEDIATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE REGULATIONS.      ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2018, REMOVAL OF THE TANK FLOOR WAS COMPLETED.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2018, THE AREA ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST FACILITATED SOIL SAMPLING FOR THE AREA OF FLOOR REMOVAL.

AT 13:00, THE CREW'S AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT BEGAN TO DETECT HYDROCARBON VAPORS IN THE EXCAVATION. CREWS IMMEDIATELY MADE INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS REGARDING THE DETECTION OF HYDROCARBON VAPORS. CREWS CONTINUED TO EXCAVATE, AND ONCE THE SEGMENT OF PIPE WAS EXPOSED, A BUBBLE ON THE COATING WAS IDENTIFIED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION ON THE PIPE. WHEN THE COATING WAS REMOVED, A DRIP STARTED TO FORM FOLLOWED BY MISTING OF OIL. AT 17:55, THE PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS SHUT DOWN. A BOLT-ON SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE PIPE. AFTER THE REPAIR, FURTHER WORK HAS CONTINUED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACTED SOIL AND CONFIRM THE SOURCE. BASED UPON THE VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT OBSERVED UPON EXPOSING THE PIPE, IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE SURROUNDING SOIL HAD BEEN IMPACTED BY THE DISCOVERED LEAK, OR WHETHER IT WAS FROM ANOTHER HISTORICAL SOURCE (I.E, NEARBY ABANDONED LINE). THE WORK HAS INCLUDED VARIOUS POTHOLES, EXPOSING THE PIPE FURTHER, AND DIGGING BELOW THE PIPELINE. ALTHOUGH NO VISIBLE SOIL CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN FOUND, A PETROLEUM ODOR CONTINUES TO BE PRESENT. SOIL SAMPLES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF IMPACT. ON JUNE 10TH, FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF LAB RESULTS IT WAS DECIDED TO CONTINUE EXCAVATION TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACTED SOIL. WITH THE ADDITIONAL EXCAVATIONS PLANNED, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS WILL LIKELY EXCEED THE $50,000 THRESHOLD FOR NRC REPORTING.

AT 5:40 PM, DETI PERSONNEL LOCATED AND CLOSED A 1"" DIAMETER VALVE ON G-134 AT THE SITE OF THE LEAK. THE 1"" DIAMETER VALVE WAS PART OF A TAP ON G-134 THAT CONSISTED OF A 16"" LONG NIPPLE AND A SECOND 1"" DIAMETER VALVE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLOSED AND PLUGGED. THE TAP ON G-134 WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK AND WAS PARTIALLY EXPOSED ABOVEGROUND. THE CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR DETI HAD CONTACTED THE TAP ON G-134 WITH THE BRUSH HOG WHICH CAUSED THE 16"" LONG NIPPLE TO BREAK RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE 1"" DIAMETER VALVE ON G-134. DETI PERSONNEL ALSO LOCATED A SHORT PIECE OF CASING PIPE THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED AROUND THE TAP ON G-134. AT 5:48 PM, DETI PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT IT WAS SAFE TO TURN OFF THE EMERGENCY TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND ALLOW TRAFFIC ON ROUTE 20 NEAR THE HASTINGS EXTRACTION PLANT. AT 9:55 PM, FLARING OF PROPANE FROM G-134 WAS STOPPED AT LOWER RUN GATE. ON 9/6/2018, DETI PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTORS WORKING FOR DETI EXCAVATED THE TAP ON G-134 AND COMPLETED REPAIRS. THE REPAIRS CONSISTED OF REMOVING THE TWO 1"" DIAMETER VALVES AND THE 16"" LONG NIPPLE, THREADING A PLUG INTO THE REMAINING THREADOLET ON G-134, BACKWELDING THE PLUG, AND APPLYING COATING TO THE PLUG. COATING WAS ALSO APPLIED TO G-134 ON A SHORT SECTION OF 4"" DIAMETER PIPE FOR WHICH COATING HAD BEEN REMOVED TO FACILITATE THE REPAIRS.

THE EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO 4777 WELLINGTON DRIVE TO COMPLETE A LEAK INVESTIGATION ORDER THAT WAS CREATED AT 2152 HOURS. DURING THE LEAK INVESTIGATION, THE EMPLOYEE SMELLED AN ODOR AT THE CORNER OF WELLINGTON DRIVE AND TRENTON COURT AND DETECTED 0.3% LEL WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR (CGI).    THE EMPLOYEE NOTICED FERTILIZER AND MULCH IN THE AREA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES AND TRAINING, THE EMPLOYEE ATTACHED A CHARCOAL FILTER TO THE CGI AND DETECTED 0.0% LEL WITH THE FILTER INSTALLED. THE EMPLOYEE WALKED TOWARDS 4773 TRENTON COURT WHEN THE RESIDENT OF THE AREA FLAGGED THE EMPLOYEE DOWN AND SHOUTED THAT THERE IS A FIRE IN THE RESIDENCE NEXT DOOR. THE EMPLOYEE STARTED TO DIAL 911 AND 4771 TRENTON COURT EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 2243 HOURS.    NORTH SHORE GAS STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS BY CLOSING A SINGLE VALVE AT 0032 HOURS ON 4/26/14 AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LONG GROVE FIRE DEPARTMENT. TWO PEOPLE RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION ONSITE AND WERE RELEASED. OTHER HOMES IN THE AREA WERE DAMAGED DUE TO THE EXPLOSION AND THE EXTENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.    THE GAS MAIN THAT FED 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 2"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1991. THE GAS SERVICE FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 1.125"" BLACK PLASTIC SERVICE THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1996. THE SERVICE DID NOT HAVE AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE AS IT WAS NOT REQUIRED BY CODE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION. FOLLOWING THE EVENT, THE GAS MAIN AND ALL ASSOCIATED GAS SERVICE PIPES WERE PRESSURE TESTED ON 5/12/14.  THE MAINS AND SERVICES WERE PRESSURE TESTED AT 44 PSIG, THE PRESSURE IN THE LINES AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION FOR 1 HOUR.  ALL MAINS AND SERVICES HELD PRESSURE DEMONSTRATING NO LEAKAGE OUT OF THESE LINES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) PIPELINE SAFETY BRANCH WITNESSED THIS TESTING. THE 4"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN IN WELLINGTON DRIVE WAS RESTARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS ON 4/27/14.    THE RISER FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE ON 5/15/14 FOR AN X-RAY AND IS SCHEDULED TO BE PERFORMED ON 5/23/14. THE METER AND REGULATOR ARE NOT IN A CONDITION THAT CAN BE TESTED.    6/4/14: AN X-RAY TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE RISER PIPE ON 5/23/14 TO TEST THE MECHANICAL ASSEMBLY.     12/31/14: THE BORESCOPE PERFORMED ON 10/10/14 WAS INCONCLUSIVE. ON 11/3/14 THE RISER ASSEMBLY WAS PRESSURE TESTED AND DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE DUE TO EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC PIPE INSIDE THE RISER. THE HOME APPLIANCES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TESTED.    9/14/15: A RE-ASSEMBLY OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE IS BEING GENERATED. PGL IS PLANNING AN ADDITIONAL TEST ON THE RISER.    12/15/15: THE RE-ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS COMPLETED.    6/27/17: FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE RISER DETERMINED A STIFFENER HAD NOT BEEN INSTALLED IN THE SERVICE, AS WAS THE PRACTICE AT THE TIME THE SERVICE WAS INSTALLED. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE RISER WAS LEAKING OR THAT THERE WAS A PATH FOR THE GAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE INTO THE HOUSE IF GAS HAD BEEN PRESENT. THEREFORE, NSG HAS DETERMINED THAT JURISDICTIONAL GAS PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY CUSTOMER OWNED PIPING AND/OR EQUIPMENT INSIDE THE HOUSE.

DOMINION ENERGY SERVICE LINE PRESSURE TEST  PRESSURE TEST CONDUCTED AUGUST 19, 2022  FOLLOWING THE ONSITE INVESTIGATION, A PRESSURE TEST OF THE AFFECTED SERVICE LINE WAS CONDUCTED.  AN AIR TEST WAS PERFORMED WITH THE RISER INCLUDED.  PRESSURE WAS UNABLE TO BUILD AS THE AIR LEAKED CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE RISER.  THE RISER WAS THEN EXCAVATED, REMOVED, AND BAGGED FOR EVIDENCE USING THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY PROCEDURE.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS CAPPED AT THE POINT THE RISER WAS CUT FROM.   AIR WAS INTRODUCED AT A PRESSURE OF 45 PSIG.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS TESTED AT 45 PSIG FOR 15 MINUTES WITH NO PRESSURE LOSS INDICATING NO LEAKS ON THE SERVICE LINE.     S-E-A LABORATORY EXAMINATION OF RISER PIPE  - LEAK TEST CONDUCTED FEBRUARY 24, 2023:  S-E-A DETERMINED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS FROM MELTED POLYETHYLENE PIPING UPSTREAM OF THE STEEL BARB FITTING THAT WAS SUBJECTED TO HEAT FROM THE FIRE. AFTER THE BREACH, THE GAS ESCAPED THROUGH THE FLEXIBLE STEEL SLEEVE. THERE IS NO AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN OPINION THAT A TEAR IN THE CORROSION PROTECTION, PRIOR TO THE FIRE, WAS CAUSAL TO THIS INCIDENT.    - DESTRUCTIVE TEST CONDUCTED JUNE 13, 2023:  S-E-A CONCLUDED THAT THE POLYETHYLENE MATERIAL DEPOSITED IN THE AREA PAST THE BARB FITTING RESULTED FROM THE POLYETHYLENE MELTING DURING THE FIRE AND THE CONTINUOUS GAS PRESSURE CAUSED THE SOFT POLYETHYLENE TO FLOW THROUGH THE BARB FITTING. UPON SECTIONING THE PORTION OF RISER PIPE NEAR THE BARB FITTING, EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT THE BARB FITTING WAS FULLY INSERTED INTO THE POLYETHYLENE PIPE, MEANING IT WAS CORRECTLY INSTALLED DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. AFTER COMPLETION OF BOTH LABORATORY EXAMINATIONS, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO S-E-A TO SUPPORT AN OPINION THAT THE RISER PIPE WAS CAUSAL TO THE INCIDENT.",548.0,0.0,60.0,71.66666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.31,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE CONTRACTOR IMMEDIATELY CALLED ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS TO REPORT THAT WE HAD A LEAK.  THE TECHNICIAN CALLED OPS CONTROL AT 1731 AND TOLD THEM TO SHUTDOWN THE HEARNE LINE BECAUSE OF A REPORTED RELEASE.  OPS CONTROL DID SEE THE SUDDEN DROP IN PRESSURE AND THE CONTROLLER IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN THE LINE AND BEGAN MAKING NOTIFICATIONS.  LOCAL EMPLOYEES WERE NOTIFIED TO RESPOND AND THE FIRST TECHNICIAN ARRIVED ON SITE AT 1805.  THE RESPONDERS TOOK APPROPRIATE ACTIONS SUCH AS MOBILIZING THE EMERGENCY TRAILER AND PLACING ABSORBENT BOOMS AND PADS IN SPECIFIC AREAS.  VAC TRUCKS WHERE REQUESTED TO COLLECT PRODUCT AND ARRIVED AT 1850 AND TAS ENVIRONMENTAL WAS CONTACTED FOR SITE CLEANUP AND REMEDIATION. THE REMAINING PRODUCT WAS DRAINED FROM THE LINE AND THE FAILED INSULATING GASKET WAS REMOVED AND REPAIRS WERE MADE.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE GASKET WAS NOT THE STANDARD GASKET THAT MAGELLAN USES TODAY. A NEW STANDARD INSULATING GASKET WAS INSTALLED AND MAGELLAN COMPLETED A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE FACILITY TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE ADDITIONAL NON-STANDARD GASKETS IN THE SYSTEM.  AS A RESULT OF THE REVIEW THERE WAS ONLY ONE INSULATING GASKET THAT WE COULD NOT CONFIRM IF IT MET OUT CURRENT STANDARD AND THEREFORE WE HAVE REPLACED THIS GASKET AS WELL.  MAGELLAN WILL CONTINUE TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE GASKET FAILURE.      THE ANALYSIS OF THE GASKET CONCLUDED THAT THE GASKET WAS A RUBBER COATED PHENOLIC GASKET.  THERE WERE NO IDENTIFIABLE MANUFACTURER MARKINGS ON THE GASKET SO THEY WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MANUFACTURER.  THE GASKET HAD RADIAL CRACKING INDICATING THAT IT WAS OVER-COMPRESSED.

THIS LEAK OCCURRED AT A PIPELINE MAINTENANCE EXCAVATION SITE, AFTER MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES HAD COMMENCED AND BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN COMPLETED, AS THE RESULT OF AN APPARENT FAILURE IN TEMPORARY EQUIPMENT THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPLETING THE NECESSARY MAINTENANCE. THE EMPLOYEE FOUND THAT PRODUCT HAD LEAKED AT THE THREADS BELOW A TEMPORARY 2"" VALVE INSTALLED ON A 2"" THREAD-O-RING (TOR) FITTING. THE FITTING AND VALVE WERE TEMPORARY AND RECENTLY HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN PREPARATION FOR A CUT-OUT OF THE 20"" PIPE PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  A REPAIR WAS MADE BY INSTALLING A COMPLETION PLUG IN THE TOR FITTING, RE-APPLYING PIPE SEALANT AND RE-TIGHTENING THE 2"" VALVE. THE 20"" PIPE SECTION AND 2"" TOR FITTING/VALVE ASSEMBLY WERE LATER REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM AS PLANNED. AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EVENT DETERMINED THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO INADEQUATE TIGHTENING OF THE VALVE DURING INSTALL. THE QUALIFICATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CONDUCTED THE INSTALL WAS SUSPENDED UNTIL THE INDIVIDUAL CAN BE PROPERLY RETRAINED.

ALL GAS WORK WAS PERFORMED BY ENOI GAS OPERATION PERSONNEL.  THE SCOPE OF WORK WAS TO CLOSE THE SERVICE VALVES SERVING THE PLANT, PURGE THE SERVICE LINES, CUT AND WELD A STEEL CAP ON BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ENDS TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL SEPARATION. INITIAL WORK WAS ON THE 20 INCH LINE FEEDING MICHOUD UNITS 1 AND 2.  PRIMARY WORK ONSITE WAS:  1. EXCAVATING THE SERVICE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE LINE.  EXCAVATION DIMENSIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET WIDE BY 15 FEET LONG BY 8 FEET DEEP TO ALLOW FOR COMPLETE 360° ACCESS TO SERVICE.  2. PURGING THE SERVICE LINE WITH INERT GAS, AND THEN GAPPING THE SERVICE TO ISOLATE THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT INTO THE PLANT.  3. WELDING STEEL CAPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NEW GAP.  4. OPENING THE SERVICE VALVE TO RE-PRESSURIZE THE SERVICE LINE UPSTREAM OF THE GAP.  WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF HAVING THE UPSTREAM VALVE FULLY OPEN, THE PRESSURE RELEASE OCCURRED (13:10 CST).  APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET UPSTREAM OF THE EXCAVATION, THE GAPPED SERVICE SEGMENT WAS BLOWN OUT OF A STRAPPED STYLE 40 DRESSER COUPLING.  THE SERVICE VALVE WAS CLOSED WITHIN 7 MINUTES.  THE RESULT OF THE BLOWOUT BUCKLED AND CRACKED CONCRETE ROADWAY, BLEW ALL THE DIRT UNDERNEATH ROADWAY AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE COUPLING INTO AND OUT OF THE EXCAVATION.

AT 10:40 PM AN ENOGEX EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT THE POWER STATION TO ASSESS THE SITUATION. THE EMPLOYEE WAS GREETED AT THE MAIN FACILITY ENTRANCE BY AN AEP INCIDENT COMMANDER. LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM THE JENKS FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS  VOLUNTARILY EVACUATED 70 PEOPLE FROM NEARBY HOMES PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF ENOGEX PERSONNEL.  AT 10:48 PM THE ENOGEX EMPLOYEE WAS ESCORTED TO THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD BY THE AEP INCIDENT COMMANDER. THE ENOGEX EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED NATURAL GAS RELIEVING TO ATMOSPHERE FROM TWO (2) 4 INCH BY 6 INCH PRESSURE SAFETY VALVES (PSV) AND TWO (2) 6 INCH BY 8 INCH PRESSURE SAFETY VALVES (PSV). UPON ENTERING THE GAS YARD, THE EMPLOYEE SMELLED AN ODOR OF MERCAPTAN AND HIS PERSONAL GAS MONITOR ALARM ACTIVATED, WHICH INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF A FLAMMABLE MIXTURE OF NATURAL GAS IN AIR. THE EMPLOYEE SAW THAT A 3/4 INCH PIPE NIPPLE, WHICH WAS A PORTION OF THE PRESSURE REGULATOR SENSING ASSEMBLY, HAD BROKEN RESULTING IN TWO (2) DEMAND REGULATORS TRAVELING TO THE FULLY OPEN POSITION, THUS INCREASING THE OPERATING PRESSURE DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATORS TO EQUAL THE 150 PSIG SET POINT OF THE FOUR (4) PSVS. AT 11:08 PM ENOGEX GAS CONTROL CLOSED AN AUTOMATED PIPELINE VALVE LOCATED UPSTREAM OF THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD TO ISOLATE THE GAS YARD FROM THE PIPELINE. NATURAL GAS CONTINUED TO ESCAPE TO ATMOSPHERE THROUGH A 3/4 INCH PIPE FITTING. AT 11:14 PM ENOGEX EMPLOYEES ISOLATED THE REGULATOR PIPING TO END THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE NIPPLE WAS REPLACED AND THE PRIMARY GAS LOAD TO THE POWER STATION RESUMED AT 1:05 AM. AN INTERNAL INCIDENT INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE AND CAUSAL FACTORS OF THE INCIDENT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A 3/4 INCH THREADED PIPE NIPPLE BROKE AT THE THREADED CONNECTION TO A 3/4 INCH THREAD-O-LET WELDED TO THE PIPING IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OF ONE OF THE REGULATORS. THE FAILURE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE VIBRATION AND/OR METAL FATIGUE. TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FINAL DEMAND PRESSURE TO THE CUSTOMER DURING A WIDE RANGE OF POWER STATION LOAD CONDITIONS, THE REGULATOR STATION DESIGN CONSISTS OF TWO REGULATORS, I.E. REGULATOR 1 AND REGULATOR 2, PLACED IN PARALLEL TO ONE ANOTHER. A SINGLE PNEUMATIC PRESSURE CONTROLLER PROVIDES THE NECESSARY LOADING PRESSURE TO EACH REGULATOR. A LOADING PRESSURE OF 3 TO 9 PSIG CONTROLS REGULATOR1 AND A LOADING PRESSURE OF 9 TO 15 PSIG CONTROLS REGULATOR 2. THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE NIPPLE IN THE PRESSURE SENSING LINE AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF PROCESS VARIABLE CAUSED REGULATOR 1 TO TRAVEL TO THE FULLY OPEN POSITION FOLLOWED BY REGULATOR 2. THIS CREATED AN INCREASE IN THE DOWNSTREAM FINAL DEMAND PRESSURE TO A PRESSURE EQUAL TO THE 150 PSIG SETPOINT OF FOUR PRESSURE SAFETY VALVES (PSVS) INSTALLED TO PROTECT THE DOWNSTREAM PIPING FROM ACCIDENTAL OVERPRESSURE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RESULTING ACTION OF THE TWO REGULATORS, ALONG WITH THE ACTIVATION OF THE FOUR PSVS DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATORS RESULTED IN THE UNCONTROLLED GAS RELEASE TO ATMOSPHERE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TIMELY RESPONSE BY ENOGEX PERSONNEL TO CONTROL THE GAS RELEASE WAS HINDERED BY THE FOLLOWING: 1)A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN AEP PERSONNEL AND THE JENKS FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SCENE (AT MAIN GATE) WELL AHEAD OF ENOGEX PERSONNEL.  TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL FROM ENTERING THE FACILITY, AEP WOULD NOT OPEN THE MAIN GATE FOR ENOGEX AS QUICKLY AS DESIRED. 2) A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS CONDITION INSIDE THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD, WHEREAS THE PRESENCE OF A FLAMMABLE GAS MIXTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE PREVENTED ENTRY. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THE ENOGEX RESPONDER COULD NOT SAFELY ENTER THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD TO MANUALLY CLOSE ISOLATION VALVES.

AT APPROXIMATELY 8:55 PM THE RELIEF VALVE SEAT MATERIAL PARTIALLY FAILED DUE TO THE INTERMITTENT ACTIVITY, ALLOWING THE VALVE TO LEAK GAS UNTIL 10:12 PM. DURING THIS EVENT FIELD PERSONNEL WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE CONTROL CENTER AND BOTH WERE TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THE RELIEF VALVE WAS TRULY ACTIVATING DUE TO AN OVERPRESSURE EVENT AND WERE TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW TO ELIMINATE OR DIVERT THE PRESSURE SOURCE. ONCE THEY DETERMINED WE DID NOT HAVE AN OVERPRESSURE EVENT LOCAL PERSONNEL OPENED A BYPASS VALVE AT 10:00 PM BETWEEN PLANT-B SUCTION AND DISCHARGE PIPING. THIS ACTION DIVERTED THE INCOMING FLOW OF GAS. ONCE THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED FIELD PERSONNEL THEN ISOLATED THE RELIEF VALVE BY CLOSING ITS ISOLATION VALVE AT APPROXIMATELY 10:12 PM.

THE ENABLE MIDSTREAM ON-CALL TEAM WAS NOTIFIED AND A NOTIFICATION CALL WAS PLACED TO THE NRC (NRC# 1189935 9/11/2017 14:14 CST). A 48 HOUR FOLLOW UP CALL (NRC#1190154) WAS PLACED ON 9/13/17 AT 11:11 CST.     AT THE LEAK LOCATION, KT-1 CONSISTS OF GRADE B STEEL, 10.75, .188 W.T. PIPE. IT WAS INSTALLED IN CLAIBORNE PARISH LA IN 1942. LINE KT-1 WAS REPAIRED WITHOUT BEING TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE, BY PLACING STOPPLES BOTH UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE LEAK SITE WITH A BYPASS. WHEN COMPLETED, THE LEAKING SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED AND INVESTIGATED FURTHER.     THE LEAK WAS FOUND TO BE LOCATED AT A CIRCUMFERENTIAL GIRTH WELD AT A CREEK CROSSING. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LEAK ON KT-1.    - THIS PIPE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED IN A SEASONAL CREEK CROSSING AND WAS SUBJECT TO ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION WHEN THE WATER LEVEL RECEDED.     - LOW CATHODIC PROTECTION LEVELS WERE PREVIOUSLY FOUND DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF NEARBY DRESSER COUPLINGS. ALTHOUGH THESE LOW LEVELS OF CP WERE REMEDIATED, CORROSION HAS PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED.  - IN 2012, THE CREEK CROSSING WAS REMEDIATED BY ADDING GROUND COVER. THE PIPE APPEARS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED STRESS FROM ADDED WEIGHT ABOVE PIPE GRADE AND LACK OF SUPPORT BELOW PIPE GRADE. THE REMAINING WALL THICKNESS AT THE GIRTH WELD APPEARS TO HAVE MECHANICALLY FAILED DUE TO THIS STRESS.

THE LEROY STORAGE FIELD WAS ON STAND-BY FOR WITHDRAWAL.  SEVERAL DEHY UNITS, INCLUDING THE UNIT ON WELL 11 WERE IDLING. THE WELL WAS OPEN, THE GLYCOL REBOILER WAS OPERATING AT 375 DEGREES, AND ONE OF THE TWO GLYCOL PUMPS WAS CIRCULATING GLYCOL THROUGH THE UNIT.   STORAGE FIELD OPERATING PRESSURE WAS 1485 PSIG.    SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE FIRE, A 1/4 INCH DIAMETER TUBING LINE ON THE BOTTOM OF A GLYCOL PUMP BROKE RELEASING A GLYCOL AND GAS MIXTURE INSIDE THE DEHY UNIT BUILDING.  AT SOME POINT, THE GLYCOL AND GAS WERE IGNITED AND THE RESULTING FIRE DAMAGED THE DEHY UNIT.      THE UINTA COUNTY (WYOMING) FIRE DEPARTMENT MONITORED THE FIRE, QUESTAR PIPELINE COMPANY OPERATING PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 09:10 AM.  AT 09:30 AM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ASSISTED COMPANY OPERATORS IN CLOSING THE WELLHEAD WING VALVE, MASTER VALVE, AND TWO VALVES NEAR THE DEHY, THE INJECTION BLOCK VALVE AND WITHDRAWAL BLOCK VALVE.   THE VALVE ON THE PLANT END OF THE LEROY #11 STORAGE LATERAL WAS ALREADY CLOSED (NO VOLUME SET POINT).   CLOSING THESE VALVES ISOLATED PRESSURE IN THE DEHY UNIT AND PRODUCTION LINE.  THE BROKEN TUBING LINE INSIDE THE DEHY UNIT CONTINUED TO VENT GAS, AND THE FIRE CONTINUED TO BURN. A 1/2 INCH VENT VALVE ON THE PRODUCTION LINE, NEAR THE WELLHEAD ESD VALVE WAS USED TO VENT PRESSURE TO ATMOSPHERE, AND HELP LOWER THE PRESSURE ON THE DEHY PIPING.      THE CONTROL VALVE ON THE WELL #11 LATERAL AT THE LEROY PLANT WAS LOCKED OUT AND TAGGED OUT, AND THE LATERAL WAS DEPRESSURED TO 140 PSIG USING A BLOWDOWN VENT IN THE PLANT.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM, AS THE PRESSURE ON THE ISOLATED DEHY UNIT NEARED ZERO, THE FIRE SUBSIDED AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SPRAYED WATER AND FOAM ON AND IN THE DEHY UNIT, TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE AND COOL THE PIPING AND VESSELS.  THE VALVES WERE CONFIRMED CLOSED, THE UNIT TOTALLY DEPRESSURED AND MOSTLY COOLED, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DEMOBILIZED AT 11:15 AM.

OBSERVATIONS MADE CONFIRMED A SHEEN ON THE SURFACE OF WATER PRESENT IN THE CULVERT AND IN THE FACILITY POND AND WAS SUSPECTED TO BE ORIGINATING FROM A SHARED COLONIAL AND PLANTATION PIPELINE ROW.  THE ROW CROSSES THE CHARLOTTE TANK FARM IN A NORTHEAST DIRECTION BETWEEN COLONIAL'S TANK DIKES #6 AND #7.  THE COLONIAL LOCAL OPERATOR WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED AND ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO SHUTDOWN COLONIAL'S OPERATING LINES WITHIN THE AREA.  PLANTATION PIPELINE WAS NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED AND ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS INITIALLY IDENTIFIED AS FUEL OIL AND WAS DIRECTLY OVER THEIR 26"" FUEL OIL/GAS LINE, WHICH WAS REPORTED IN FUEL OIL SERVICE AT THE TIME. PLANTATION BEGAN EXCAVATING AT 15:00 AND COMPLETED THEIR INVESTIGATION AT 03:29 ON 1/1/2019 WITH NO INDICATION OF A LEAK FROM THEIR LINE.  AT THIS POINT, COLONIAL ASSUMED THE LEAD FOR THE RESPONSE WITH A FOCUS ON THE 32"" DIAMETER 762 TANK LINE. THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS WAS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY. THE LOCATION OF THE TANK LINE RELATIVE TO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE CHARLOTTE DF REQUIRED HAND EXCAVATION, WHICH LIMITED PROGRESS DURING THE RESPONSE DUE TO THE LIMITED WORKING SPACE, DEPTH OF EXCAVATION, AND MANUAL METHODS REQUIRED.    EXCAVATION TO EXPOSE TANK LINE 762 AND IDENTIFY A LEAK SOURCE CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL DAYS.  ON JANUARY 3, 2019, THE LEAK SOURCE WAS IDENTIFIED.  THE LEAK SOURCE WAS AN APPROXIMATELY 0.5-INCH DIAMETER HOLE IN THE TANK LINE WALL LOCATED ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE LINE (07:30 POSITION).  AT 02:20 ON JANUARY 4TH, A 2 FT. TYPE B STEEL SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON TANK LINE 762 TO PERMANENTLY REPAIR THE LEAK SOURCE. A MAGNETIC PARTICLE TEST WAS COMPLETED AT APPROXIMATELY 14:00 ON JANUARY 4 AND VERIFIED THE INTEGRITY OF THE TYPE B SLEEVE WELDS. THE TANK AND TANK LINE REMAIN OUT OF SERVICE.     APPROXIMATELY 145 BBLS OF PRODUCT HAVE BEEN RECOVERED AS OF JANUARY 21, 2019, WITH AN ESTIMATED 407 BBLS OF KEROSENE BEING RELEASED.

IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ANOTHER 8,250 TONS OF SOIL IS AFFECTED, FOR AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 9,000 TONS CONTAINING AN ESTIMATED 221 BBLS OF PRODUCT.      THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED BY THE COLONIAL CONTROL CENTER AT 10:07 ON THE JANUARY 1ST BECAUSE OF THE SURFACE WATER IMPACTS. THE NCDEM WAS NOTIFIED AT 10:45 ON JANUARY 1ST SINCE THE RELEASE WAS GREATER THAN 25 GALLONS AND THERE WERE SURFACE WATER IMPACTS.    UPDATE 1/29/2020: AFTER REVIEWING THE DATA COMPILED FROM THE INTERNAL INSPECTION, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO BE INTERNAL CORROSION ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK LINE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS OF THE INCIDENT WERE FOUND TO BE INADEQUATE INSPECTION AND INADEQUATE PLANNING. A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WAS COMPLETED TO EVALUATE THE SUGGESTIONS MADE BY THE ASSET INTEGRITY TEAM TO DETERMINE NEXT STEPS IN REPLACEMENT OF THE TANK LINE. SEVERAL PREVENTATIVE ACTION PLANS WERE ALSO COMPILED TO INCLUDE; A RE-EVALUATION OF THE RISK PRIORITIZATION LIST OF TANK LINES TO ENSURE TANKS WITH INTERNAL FLOATING SUCTIONS THAT DO-NOT EXPERIENCE BI-DIRECTIONAL FLOW ARE THOROUGHLY ASSESSED AND TO CONSIDER INSTALLING INTERNAL MONITORING SYSTEM TOOLS IN AREAS KNOWN FOR HIGHER RISK OF INTERNAL CORROSION.

THIS FACILITY IS OWNED BY ONEOK ARBUCKLE PIPELINE, L.L.C. AND OPERATED BY ONEOK NGL PIPELINE, L.L.C. ('ONEOK').  THE FLASH FIRE OCCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF CHANGING THE FILTER ELEMENTS CONTAINED IN A HORIZONTAL PIPELINE DELIVERY FILTER USED IN MIXED NATURAL GAS LIQUID (Y-GRADE) SERVICE AT THE FACILITY.  AS PART OF THE FILTER ELEMENT CHANGE PROCESS, THE FILTER VESSEL WAS ISOLATED, THE PRODUCT WAS EVACUATED THROUGH FLARING, AND THE VESSEL WAS STEAMED TO A TEMPERATURE OF 200°F IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE RESIDUAL HYDROCARBONS. SUBSEQUENTLY, LOCKOUT-TAGOUT WAS APPLIED, A PERMIT ISSUED (ALLOWING HOT WORK), AND CONTRACT PERSONNEL COMMENCED WITH OPENING THE VESSEL TO CHANGE THE ELEMENTS.  ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING WAS PERFORMED AT THE VESSEL DOOR PRIOR TO REMOVING THE DIRTY FILTER ELEMENTS AND A ZERO PERCENT LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT WAS OBSERVED. DURING THE ELEMENT CHANGE PROCESS, WHILE THE NEW (CLEAN) FILTER ELEMENTS WERE BEING SECURED TO THE FILTER RODS USING A CORDLESS IMPACT WRENCH, A FLASH FIRE OCCURRED.

DURING THE RESPONSE AND POST RESPONSE, ALL FREE PRODUCT AND WATER WERE REMOVED VIA VACUUM TRUCKS AND PLACED IN ON-SITE FRAC TANKS. THE FREE PRODUCT AND CONTAMINATED SOILS WERE LOCALIZED AND CONTAINED ON SITE. NO PRODUCT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE OWS OR ON THE SITE POND. ALL EXCAVATED CONTAMINATED SOILS WERE SEGREGATED AND WERE PLACED IN EITHER LINED ROLL OFFS OR SEGREGATED IN STOCKPILES ON PLASTIC FOLLOWING BMPS FOR SOIL CONTAINMENT. DURING POST RESPONSE ACTIVITIES CONTAMINATED SOILS WERE EXCAVATED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND IN COOPERATION WITH THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT. ALL REQUIRED SOILS WERE EXCAVATED AND WILL BE HAULED OFF SITE TO THE DISPOSAL/RECYCLING FACILITIES AS DIRECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL. ALL PCW IS ON SITE AND WAITING ON DIRECTION FROM ENVIRONMENTAL FOR DISPOSAL/RECYCLING.  03-26-2021 UPDATE:  COLONIAL CONDUCTED AN INCIDENT ANALYSIS OF THIS EVENT AND CONCLUDED THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS MATERIAL FAILURE - A SMALL PIN HOLE WAS DISCOVERED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAIN LINE FROM LINE 03 - UNIT 3. THE HOLE WAS A RESULT OF INTERNAL CORROSION ON THE 6 INCH DRAIN LINE. THE CUT OUT PIPE WILL BE SENT OFF FOR LAB ANALYSIS.   ALL ACCESSIBLE SOILS WERE HAULED OFF SITE TO DISPOSAL/RECYCLING FACILITIES. ALL PETROLEUM-CONTAMINATED WASTE (PCW) WAS SENT FOR OFF-SITE DISPOSAL/RECYCLING. THE UPDATED VOLUME WAS CALCULATED FROM SCALE TICKETS AND LABORATORY ANALYSES OF SOIL EXCAVATED AND SOIL BORINGS. THE COST ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN UPDATED.  2/7/22 UPDATE:   COLONIAL CONTRACTED THE SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE (SWRI) TO ANALYZE PORTIONS OF THE REMOVED DRAIN SYSTEM AND EVALUATE THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. SWRI DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS A RESULT OF INTERNAL CORROSION MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY MICROBIOLOGICALLY INDUCED CORROSION (MIC). COLONIAL MITIGATED THE RISK OF FUTURE LEAKS BY REPLACING THE ENTIRE DRAIN SYSTEM AND ESTABLISHING A PERIODIC FLUSHING PROGRAM. IN PART TO THE INVESTIGATION EVENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE ENVIRONMENTAL TEAM FOUND NO INDICATION OF A HISTORICAL LEAK. THE LAB ANALYSIS ASSOCIATED TO THIS UPDATE WAS RECEIVED AFTER AN INITIAL ANALYSIS ATTEMPT WAS REJECTED DUE TO SAMPLING ERROR, THEREBY CAUSING DELAY IN THE CLOSURE OF THIS INCIDENT.

A VAPOR CLOUD INITIALLY PREVENTED IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE LOCATION. ONCE THE AREA WAS ISOLATED, AND IT WAS SAFE TO EXCAVATE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS THE RESULT OF A LONGITUDINAL SEAM FAILURE ON THE PIPE. THE PIPE WAS SENT TO A LAB TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC FAILURE MECHANISM.     SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE 3/30/2022:  THE LAB ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE WAS CAUSED BY CORROSION FATIGUE LIKELY FROM LACK OF FUSION ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE WELD (ERW) REGIONS LOCATED ON THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE.  PART K CONTRIBUTING FACTORS,  INTERNAL CORROSION, CORROSIVE COMMODITY - EXPLANATION  THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS FURTHER INDICATED THAT CORROSION FATIGUE OCCURS WHEN MATERIAL EXPERIENCES CYCLIC LOADING WHILE EXPOSED TO A CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT. EXPOSURE TO THE CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT CAUSES A DECREASE IN THE FATIGUE RESISTANCE OF A COMPONENT AND RESULTS IN FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH AT LOWER CYCLIC STRESSES. THE AREA WITH LACK OF FUSION WAS SUBJECT TO THE CORROSIVE ELEMENTS IN THE PROCESS STREAM OVER ITS 62 YEARS OF SERVICE. ADDITIONALLY, THE LACK OF FUSION DEFECT ACTED AS A STRESS RISER FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF FATIGUE DAMAGE FROM PRESSURE CYCLING EVENTS DURING THE LONG SERVICE HISTORY. ALTHOUGH NO PRESSURE SPIKES WERE REPORTED AT THE TIME OF RUPTURE, CRACK ARREST LINES CONSISTENT WITH FATIGUE CRACK PROPAGATION WERE OBSERVED ON THE FRACTURE SURFACE.

AN INSPECTION OF THE AREA CONDUCTED THE PREVIOUS DAY, DID NOT NOTE THE LIFT BARGE OR DREDGE IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPELINE. AFTER OBSERVING THE OIL SHEEN, NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO PLAINS MANAGEMENT, USCG AND LOUISIANA STATE POLICE HAZ MAT.  CONTRACTORS WERE CONTACTED TO BEGIN MOBILIZING TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE.  A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WAS ALSO CONTACTED TO INVESTIGATE THE OIL SLICK WHICH APPEARED TO BE EMANATING NEAR OR AROUND THE JACK UP VESSEL.    A MAGNETOMETER SURVEY SHOWED THE 12-INCH BOA PIPELINE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 600 FEET OFF OF THE LIFT BARGE SEVEN INAGHA PORT SIDE AND NORTH OF THE VESSEL.  MULTI SCANNING OF THE SEA BOTTOM INDICATED NO EVIDENCE THAT THE SEVEN INAGHA SPUDS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE PIPELINE.  THE CAPTAIN OF SEVEN INAGHA DID NOT NOTIFY ONE-CALL, BUT DID NOTIFY THE USCG WHEN A SHEEN WAS OBSERVED AROUND HIS VESSEL.    FROM THE MULTI SCAN IMAGING AND OTHER INVESTIGATION DATA, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DREDGE VESSEL DREDGE TEXAS STRUCK THE BOA 12-INCH PIPELINE WITH ITS CUTTER HEAD WHEN IT WAS LOWERED TO HELP STOP THE FORWARD MOTION OF THE DREDGE TO CONDUCT MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.  SEA BOTTOM IMAGES CLEARLY SHOW THE CRATER FORMED BY DROPPING THE CUTTER HEAD INTERSECTING THE PIPELINE ALIGNMENT.  THE DREDGE WAS FOUND ANCHORED ABOVE THE PIPELINE.

TO REPAIR THE PIPE, A CLAMP DEVICE WAS CONSTRUCTED TO SUPPORT THE DAMAGED PIPE IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE LIFTED TO A HEIGHT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE REPAIRS.  UPON REMOVAL OF THE CLAMP IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE DAMAGE WAS A RESULT OF THE CUTTER HEAD.

KM WAS ORIGINALLY UNABLE TO DEFINITIVELY PINPOINT THE SOURCE AND REMOVED APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET OF PIPE ALONG WITH THE CHECKVALVE AND BYPASS VALVE AND REPLACED WITH PRE-TESTED PIPE. THE EXACT SOURCE OF THE RELEASE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED VIA TESTING AS THE BODY BLEED VENTING PORT FITTING. THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE LEAK HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE DUE TO GALVANIC CORROSION IN THE BODY BLEED FITTING ASSEMBLY OF THE 4-INCH AUXILIARY (CHECK VALVE BYPASS) VALVE POSSIBLY CAUSED BY RESIDUAL WATER TRAPPED IN THE FITTING ASSEMBLY. THE SOURCE OF THE WATER IS UNDETERMINABLE.    NOTE: PART A,  **8 ' MIXTURE OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL    **9  A SOIL AND GROUNDWATER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE LATERAL AND VERTICAL EXTENT WAS CONDUCTED AND THE AMOUNT RELEASED HAS BEEN FINALIZED.    **11 ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNT TO BE RECOVERED WILL BE DONE THROUGH LONG-TERM REMEDIATION EFFORTS, IF ANY.    NOTE: PART D,  **4.A & 5 MINOR AMOUNT REACHED GROUNDWATER; MONITORING IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD.    WE ARE FINALIZING THIS REPORT BECAUSE THE RELEASE RESPONSE CONSISTS ONLY OF LONG-TERM REMEDIATION AND MONITORING CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF AN AUTHORIZED GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY, THE ESTIMATED FINAL COSTS AND VOLUME RECOVERED HAVE BEEN PREDICTED WITH A REASONABLE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY, THE VOLUME OF PRODUCT RECOVERED OVER TIME WILL CONSISTENTLY DECREASE TO THE POINT WHERE AN ESTIMATED TOTAL VOLUME RECOVERED CAN BE PREDICTED WITH A REASONABLE DEGREE OF ACCURACY, AND WE CAN JUSTIFY THAT CONTINUATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILINGS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION WHICH WILL BE CRITICALLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT CONTAINED IN THE FINAL REPORT. IF ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE, WE WILL SUPPLEMENT THIS REPORT.    NOTE: PART E,  **5.A  TYPE OF UPSTREAM VALVE USED TO INITIALLY ISOLATE RELEASE SOURCE:         AN MOV WAS INITIALLY REMOTELY CLOSED UPSTREAM OF THE RELEASE SITE @ MP 70.12 @ 1118, THEN AN UPSTREAM MANUAL VALVE WAS CLOSED @ MP 75.32 @ 1206, THEN A DOWNSTREAM MANUAL VALVE WAS CLOSED @ MP 76.75 (APPROXIMATELY 6 FEET DOWNSTREAM OF THE RELEASE SITE) @1208 ISOLATING THE RELEASE SITE.

LOCAL TIME (MT), EL PASO NATURAL GAS (EPNG) GAS-CONTROL NOTIFIED A PHOENIX BASED EPNG TECHNICIAN THAT THERE WAS A COMPRESSOR UNIT SHUTDOWN AT THE ALAMO LAKE STATION.  AFTER CONFIRMING THE SHUTDOWN REMOTELY, THE TECHNICIAN DROVE TO THE SITE AND FOUND THAT THE COMPRESSOR UNITS WERE NOT RUNNING, THE STATION SUCTION VALVE WAS OPEN AND THE SUCTION-VENT-VALVE WAS OPEN AND VENTING GAS.  THE STATION DISCHARGE AND VENT VALVES WERE CLOSED. THE TECHNICIAN CLOSED THE STATION SUCTION VALVES, STOPPING THE VENTING OF GAS, AND PROCEEDED TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE COMPRESSOR STATION.  AFTER REVIEWING THE STATUS, THE COMPRESSORS WERE RESTARTED AND THE TECHNICIAN REMAINED AT THE STATION FOR A COUPLE MORE HOURS TO MONITOR THE STATION.  THE QUANTITY OF GAS LOSS WAS NOT DETERMINED BY THE TECHNICIAN DURING THE AUGUST 3, 2016 EVENT.  ON AUGUST 4, 2016 AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE STATION SHUTDOWN FOUND THAT THERE WERE TWO EQUIPMENT ISSUES.  THE STATION'S SUCTION-VENT-VALVE HAD A SHORTED CLOSE-SOLENOID AND THE MOMENTARY-CLOSE PUSH-BUTTON THAT OPENS THE STATION SUCTION VALVE WAS STUCK CLOSED.  BOTH OF THESE COMPONENTS WERE REPAIRED AND THE COMPRESSOR UNITS AT THE STATION RETURNED TO SERVICE.  ON AUGUST 10, 2016, DURING THE EVALUATION OF GAS LOSS EVENTS IN THE AREA, EPNG PHOENIX AREA OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT BECAME AWARE THAT THE QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED FOR THIS EVENT MET THE REPORTING CRITERIA FOR AN INCIDENT, UNINTENTIONAL GAS LOSS GREATER THAN 3000MCF, UNDER 49 CFR 191.5 AT WHICH TIME THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NRC REPORT WAS SUBMITTED, EPNG ALSO NOTIFIED THE PHMSA WESTERN REGION AND THE ARIZONA CORPORATION COMMISSION PIPELINE SAFETY DIVISION.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENTIONAL GAS RELEASE WAS AT LEAST TWO LOW-RESISTANCE TO GROUND FAULTS ON THE STATIONS 135 VDC CONTROL SYSTEM. BASED ON THIS FINDING, THE FIELD WIRING FOR BOTH THE STATION'S HIGH DISCHARGE PRESSURE SWITCH CIRCUIT AND THE STATION'S DISCHARGE LOADING VALVE CIRCUIT WILL BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE STATION'S DC SYSTEM WILL BE EVALUATED FOR ADDITIONAL LOW-RESISTANCE GROUND AND/OR DETERIORATION.

INVESTIGATIONS THUS FAR CONFIRM THE GROUND FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO A RELATIVELY RAPID LOADING OF A LAYER OF SOFT CLAYS BETWEEN 25 AND 40 FT BELOW THE GROUND SURFACE. DTE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE RELATIVELY RAPID LOADING WAS CAUSED BY THE INCREASE IN HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF A MILL SCALE STOCKPILE AT THE FORT IRON AND METAL FACILITY.  THE GROUND FAILURE OCCURRED CONCENTRICALLY AROUND THE LARGE STOCKPILE OF MATERIAL LOCATED AT THE PROPERTY, A METAL SCRAP YARD OWNED AND OPERATED BY FORT IRON & METAL COMPANY.

THE FIRE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND NO FINAL REPORT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE FIRE MARSHAL.    UPDATED FEBRUARY 11, 2013:  THIS UPDATE IS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE MINNESOTA STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S INVESTIGATION REPORT.  WE AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION IN THE REPORT THAT THE FIRE WAS ACCIDENTAL.  THE AREA OF ORIGIN FOR THE FIRE WAS INSIDE THE RESIDENCE.  THE FIRST MATERIAL THAT IGNITED WAS NATURAL GAS VAPORS THAT HAD LEECHED INTO THE RESIDENCE AFTER A GAS SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN CRACKED OR BROKEN.  THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THE RISER AND A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE.  WHILE THE EXACT IGNITION FACTOR IS NOT KNOWN, ANY APPLIANCE THAT WOULD CYCLE ON OR OFF WOULD LIKELY HAVE PROVIDED SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO IGNITE THE NATURAL GAS/AIR MIXTURE ONCE IT HAD REACHED THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.    WITH RESPECT TO THE BROKEN OR CRACKED GAS SERVICE LINE THAT RESULTED IN THE GAS LEAK, WE KNOW THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE PRECEDING 4 YEARS, THE RESIDENT HAD FILLED A SINK-TYPE OF HOLE IN THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE HOME THAT WAS ABOVE THE GAS LINE AND NEAR THE METER.  THE SETTLING OF THE SOIL IN THAT HOLE COULD HAVE PUT STRESS ON THE GAS LINE.  IN ADDITION, IN THE DAY (OR DAYS) BEFORE THE FIRE, A MEMBER OF THE RESIDENT'S FAMILY HAD ADDED CLASS FIVE ROCK TO THE TOP OF THE SINK HOLE AREA AND THEN PACKED IT DOWN WITH A BOBCAT, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDED TO OR CREATED STRESS ON THE GAS LINE, POSSIBLY ENOUGH TO CRACK OR BREAK IT AT THAT TIME.  XCEL ENERGY DOES NOT HAVE RECORDS OF THIS CUSTOMER CONTACTING US FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE SINK HOLE NEAR THE GAS LINE, OR MAKING US AWARE OF ANY RELATED PROBLEMS.  OUR RECORDS REVEAL THAT THE METER LOCATION AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL LOCATION OF THE METER.   WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE METER WAS MOVED BY AN UNKNOWN PARTY, NOT XCEL ENERGY, TO MAKE ROOM FOR A GARAGE ADDITION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE HOUSE APPROXIMATELY 2007.    THE SERVICE LINE TO THIS LOCATION WILL BE RUN AT THE REQUEST OF THE CUSTOMER AFTER HOME IS REBUILT.",8217.0,0.0,60.0,83.33333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.555,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE RESIDUAL HYDROCARBONS WERE PURGED WITH NITROGEN FROM THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM VALVE LOCATIONS.  THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED WITH A BACK-HOE TO EXPOSE ENOUGH PIPE TO FACILITATE THE REPAIR.  AFTER THE LINE WAS CONFIRMED TO BE FREE OF HYDROCARBONS, ONSITE CONTRACTORS (S&S CONSTRUCTION) PROCEEDED TO COLD CUT THE EAST SIDE OF THE LINE.  THE FIRST COLD CUT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF PIPE WAS REMOVED.

PIPELINE INSPECTORS VISITED THE SITE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ON 10/31/2012 TO VERIFY THE LEAK AND TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS ON PPG'S ETHYLENE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 16:45 ON 10/31/2012 OPERATIONS BEGAN DEPRESSURIZING THE ETHYLENE PIPELINE WHICH CONTINUED UNTIL 11/5/2012 WHEN PURGING WITH NITROGEN BEGAN.  PURGING AND DEPRESSURIZATION TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE WAS COMPLETE ON 11/7/2012.    THE LEAK SITE WAS THEN EXCAVATED AND THE SECTION OF LEAKING PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH NEW 8 INCH, 0.219 WT, GRADE B X42, FBE COATED, PRESSURE TESTED PIPE.  A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION DUE TO INDUCED AC CURRENT ON THE PIPELINE AND A SMALL AREA OF DAMAGE TO THE PIPE COATING WHICH EXPOSED THE STEEL PIPE.  THE DAMAGE TO THE PIPE COATING WAS THEORIZED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A PROBE STRIKE THAT OCCURRED WHEN SOMEONE WAS LOCATING THE PIPELINE.  THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 11/11/2012.    AT THE TIME OF THE LEAK PPG PIPELINE SUPERVISION DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION MET THE DEFINITION OF AN INCIDENT AS DEFINED BY 49 CFR 191.3; THE LEAK OCCURRED IN A VERY REMOTE AREA IN THE CALCASIEU PARISH MARSH (AT LEAST 5 MILES TO THE NEAREST DWELLING), THERE WERE NO DEATHS OR INJURIES, NO EXPLOSION OR FIRE, AND ACTUAL CALCULATED GAS LOST WAS 866 MCF (WELL BELOW THE 3 MILLION CUBIC FEET DEFINED AS AN INCIDENT).  THE ONLY DIRECT PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS TO A SECTION OF 8 INCH UNDERGROUND PIPING AND THAT REPAIR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN $50,000.  THEREFORE, BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED BY PPG'S PIPELINE SUPERVISION THAT NOTIFICATION TO THE NRC WAS NOT REQUIRED AND SUBMISSION OF AN ELECTRONIC WRITTEN REPORT TO PHMSA WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE EVENT WAS NOT REQUIRED.    THIS YEAR PPG'S PIPELINE SUPERVISOR ATTENDED A THIRD PARTY DOT PIPELINE COMPLIANCE TRAINING CLASS AND WAS INFORMED THAT PROPERTY DAMAGE INCLUDED ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING A LEAK; NOT JUST THE COST FOR THE IMMEDIATE REPAIR TO THE PIPE.  AFTER RETURNING TO HIS WORK LOCATION, THE PIPELINE SUPERVISOR LOCATED AN ADVISORY BULLETIN (ADB-02-01) RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE.  WITH THE BENEFIT OF THIS ADDITIONAL UNDERSTANDING, THE PPG PIPELINE SUPERVISOR RE-EVALUATED ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPAIR AND REVALUED THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AS EXCEEDING THE $50,000 THRESHOLD.",13818.0,0.0,1066.0,78.33020637898687,1.0,0.0,0.0,21.9,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE CONTROL CENTER SHUT DOWN LINES 6A, 14, 13, AND 61 IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  ENBRIDGE STAFF WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA.  OIL FROM THE RELEASE MIGRATED INTO NEAR-BY STORM WATER AND SEPTIC SEWER SYSTEMS, AND REACHED BOTH A LOCAL STORM WATER RETENTION POND AND WATER TREATMENT PLANT.  LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS, EPA, NTSB AND PHMSA RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT AND WERE ONSITE DURING THE EXCAVATION, REPAIR AND LINE-FILL OF LINE 6A. DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THIS LEAK TO A NUMBER OF LOCAL BUSINESSES, ROMEOVILLE EMERGENCY RESPONSE OFFICIALS ADVISED APPROXIMATELY 470 PEOPLE TO VACATE THE AREA DURING THE INITIAL PHASES OF THE RESPONSE TO FACILITATE SITE ACCESS AND CONTAINMENT EFFORTS. ENBRIDGE ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $40 AND $60 MILLION EXCLUSIVE OF FINES AND PENALTIES. THESE CHARGES INCLUDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, CONTAINMENT AND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRUDE OIL RELEASE, COSTS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE AND RELATED INSPECTION COSTS, POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES AND LOST REVENUE. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO ACCURATELY PROJECT THE TOTAL COST OF THE LEAK AND ITS REMEDIATION, HOWEVER WE ARE UNABLE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE SPECIFIC DETAIL REQUESTED IN THIS FORM DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EFFORTS. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE NTSB, THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE AND THE WATER LINE THAT WAS WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY HAVE BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  PENDING THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL TESTING AND FAILURE INVESTIGATION, ENBRIDGE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE COMPLETE AND FINAL DATA REGARDING CAUSE FOR THIS ORIGINAL REPORT SUBMISSION.    VOLUME OF CRUDE OIL RELEASED FROM THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN REVISED TO THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATES:  7,538 BARRELS, WITH 7,538 RECOVERED AND 1,131 BARRELS REACHING AN UNNAMED DRAIN AND RETENTION POND. THE 7,538 BBLS IS THE ESIMATED AMOUNT RECOVERED IN TANKAGE AND MAY NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL OIL RECOVERED IN WASTE STREAMS.      ENBRIDGE CONTINUES TO WORK THROUGH THE SITE REMEDIATION PROGRAM WITH THE ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (IEPA).  THE REMEDIAL OBJECTIVES REPORT (ROR)/RESPONSE ACTION PLAN (RAP) WAS APPROVED BY THE IEPA AND THE RAP HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT THE SITE.  THE ENBRIDGE ENVIRONMENT GROUP MEETS ANNUALLY WITH THE IEPA TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT DIRECTION.  GROUND WATER AND SURFACE WATER WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS.  SINCE THE INITIAL RELEASE, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY DETECTIONS ABOVE CRITERIA IN EITHER THE GROUND OR SURFACE WATER.  WE ARE CURRENTLY MONITORING A NETWORK OF 30 MONITORING WELLS AND 5 SURFACE WATER LOCATIONS ON A COMBINED QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS.     APPROXIMATELY 15,049 TONS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AND DISPOSED OFF-SITE.  SITE CLOSURE WAS RECEIVED FROM THE IEPA ON AUGUST 12, 2013.      THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS EROSION CAUSED BY WATER JET IMPINGEMENT FROM A LEAKING 6-INCH DIAMETER WATER PIPE 5 INCHES BELOW OUR PIPELINE.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE INTERRUPTION OF THE CATHODIC PROTECTION CURRENTS BY THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE IMPROPERLY INSTALLED WATER PIPE.",15592.0,1.0,619.0,16.31663974151858,1.0,1.0,0.0,21.585,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE PRESSURE HAD DROPPED FROM 1,190 TO 1,156 PSIG, FOLLOWED BY A SUBSEQUENT DROP TO 1,035 PSIG AFTER SHUTTING-IN PRESSURE REGULATION. AT 9:35 PM, FIELD PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED BY A NEAR-BY PROPERTY OWNER REPORTING THE SOUND OF A GAS LINE LEAK; SUBSEQUENTLY, COMPANY OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED TO RESPOND TO THE EVENT LOCATION.    FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 9:45 PM AND OBSERVED GAS BLOWING; THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT CLOSED CUNNINGHAM ROAD AT THIS TIME. AT 9:54 PM A COMPANY SF TECHNICIAN CONFIRMED THAT THE REPORTED LEAK HAD BEEN ISOLATED BY OPERATING THE CRITICAL VALVE. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND PHMSA ACCIDENT INCIDENT DIVISION WERE CONTACTED WITHIN 1 HOUR OF CONFIRMED DISCOVERY AT 10:50 PM. NRC ONE-HOUR (1291972) AND 48-HR (1292099) REPORTS WERE COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 11TH AND NOVEMBER 13TH RESPECTIVELY. THE FAILED STORAGE LINE (9190) WAS SECURED AND SENT TO A METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS LABORATORY TO EVALUATE AND DETERMINE THE PROBABLE CAUSE BEHIND THIS PIPELINE FAILURE.     THE REPAIR OF THE LINE CONSISTED OF PIPE REPLACEMENT. THE METALLURGICAL ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION IDENTIFIED ALONG THE 6:00 O'CLOCK ORIENTATION OF THE PIPE. THE ABSENCE OF AN EXTERNAL COATING AND EXPOSURE TO ATMOSPHERE (I.E. DE-COUPLED FROM THE SOIL ELECTROLYTE) WERE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE CORROSION OF THE PIPE.

THE TRACTOR WAS EQUIPPED WITH HYDRAULIC HAY FORKS ON THE FRONT.  AS HE MADE HIS LAST PATH TURNING EAST, THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL OF THE TRACTOR BROKE AT THE AXLE SPINDLE DRIVING THE HAY FORKS INTO THE GROUND STRIKING THE 8' CRCT RED RIVER PIPELINE.  THIS CAUSED THE TRACTOR TO IMMEDIATELY STOP IN ITS TRACKS BENDING THE LEFT FRONT HAY FORK DOWNWARD AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE AND CAUSING THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE TO BREAK.  AT THAT TIME, THE FARMER NOTICED OIL COMING FROM THE GROUND AND PROCEEDED TO CALL THE EMERGENCY PHONE NUMBERS FROM THE PIPELINE MARKERS. THE FARMER WAS NOT INJURED DURING THE INCIDENT.    AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30AM, AN EMERGENCY CALL WAS RECEIVED AT THE PAUL'S VALLEY DISPATCH AND THE MEGELLAN PIPELINE COMPANY CALLED CRCT OPERATIONS TO INFORM THEM OF A RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL.  THE SOURCE OF THE PRODUCT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT AS THERE ARE FOUR PIPELINES IN THE RIGHT OF WAY IN THE AREA.  THE LEAK WAS LATER CONFIRMED AS THE CRCT RED RIVER PIPELINE.   THE RED RIVER PIPELINE IS 102 MILES OF PIPELINE.

THE AMEREN ILLINOIS FIRST RESPONDER STOPPED THE BLOWING GAS USING AN EXPANDABLE PLUG INTO THE CUT 1/2"" SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 80 MINUTES LATER, AFTER THE CUT GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN PLUGGED AND AN AMEREN ILLINOIS CREW WAS ON SITE TO MAKE REPAIRS, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT THE STRUCTURE LOCATED AT 430 N WEST STREET. THE POST INVESTIGATION OF THE AREA REQUIRED A TEMPORARY OUTAGE TO 33 GAS CUSTOMERS.      REVISION AS OF (12/20/2016):    THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT, GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SHORT TIMEFRAME BETWEEN THE DAMAGED GAS SERVICE AT 419 N WEST ST AND THE INCIDENT OCCURRING AT 430 N WEST ST, IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE THIRD PARTY DAMAGE OF THE GAS SERVICE. THE CONTRACTOR INSTALLING A WATER MAIN IN THE STREET HAD A VALID DIG TICKET, BUT THE SERVICE WAS INACCURATELY MARKED INACCURATELY MARKED IN THE FIELD BY THE LOCATOR.  ADDITIONAL POST-INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AT THE 430 N WEST STREET LOCATION DETERMINED THAT THE SEWER TRAP FOR THE SEWER LATERAL INTO THE STRUCTURE WAS DRY.

PART A, LINE 12 - THERE WERE TWO INJURIES REPORTED, HOWEVER AMEREN ILLINOIS COULD ONLY CONFIRM THAT ONE REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.  PART A, LINE 13 - THE GAS MAIN WAS SHUT DOWN AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THE AMEREN ILLINOIS FIRST RESPONDER HAD REMOVED THE PLUG STOPPER AFTER THE INCIDENT, AND THEN THE ADJACENT 1-1/4"" PLASTIC GAS MAIN WAS EXCAVATED AND SQUEEZED OFF INTERRUPTING SERVICE TO THE 400 BLOCK OF N WEST ST. THE GAS MAIN SERVING THE 200 AND 300 BLOCK OF N WEST ST WAS ALSO TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. THE GAS MAINS WERE REENERGIZED UPON COMPLETION OF AIR PRESSURE TESTING OF THE GAS FACILITIES IN THE 200 - 400 BLOCK OF N WEST ST.

AT APPROXIMATELY 16:51, THE SUPPLIER WAS NOTIFIED TO STOP FLOW AND BUCKEYE PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE 5000 AREA TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 16:59, BUCKEYE PERSONNEL DISCOVERED THAT A PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE (PRV) ON A COALESCER WAS CONTINUOUSLY VENTING TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  THE SET PRESSURE OF THE PRV WAS RELEASING AT THE INTENDED PRESSURE OF 275 PSIG.  OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES, BUCKEYE PERSONNEL INTERMITTENTLY ISOLATED THE PRV FROM THE COALESCER IN AN ATTEMPT TO RE-SEAT THE DEVICE BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  AT THIS TIME, THE PRV WAS ALLOWED TO VENT TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  AT 17:30, A CONTRACTOR WAS CALLED TO ASSIST WITH THE PRV.  AT 18:11, THE CONTRACTOR ISOLATED THE PRV FROM THE SYSTEM AND THE RELEASE OF PROPANE TO THE ATMOSPHERE WAS COMPLETELY STOPPED.  IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE MASTER CONTROL CENTER (MCC) WIRING ASSOCIATED WITH AN ESD IN THE 5000 AREA BECAME LOOSE WHICH IN TURN CAUSED ALL MOVS AND ESDS IN THE CORRESPONDING AREA TO FAIL CLOSED, WHICH IS THE ENGINEERED FAIL SAFE POSITION.  THE ACTIVATION OF THE PRV WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE SUPPLIER'S FEED TEMPORARILY BYPASSING BUCKEYE'S ESD VIA A TRV FOR THE DURATION OF TIME THAT IT TOOK TO CONTACT THE SUPPLIER AND NOTIFY THEM OF THE CLOSURE OF OUR MOVS AND ESDS.  DURING THIS TIME THE PIPELINE SYSTEM REACHED THE SET PRESSURE OF THE PRV, 275 PSIG.  AS THE PIPELINE SYSTEM REACHED 275 PSIG THE COALESCER PRV ACTIVATED AND THE AUTO REFRIGERATION OF PROPANE RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF ICE WITHIN THE PRV.  THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE ACHIEVED BY THE SYSTEM WAS VERIFIED AS 286 PSIG, WHICH IS LOWER THAN THE ESTABLISHED MOP OF 340 PSIG.   BUCKEYE CONCLUDED THAT THE WIRING WAS NOT ADEQUATELY TIGHTENED DURING INSTALLATION AND THE LOOSE WIRING WAS SIMPLY TIGHTENED AND SECURED PROPERLY.  AS AN ADDED PREVENTATIVE MEASURE, BUCKEYE MODIFIED THE EXISTING CONTROL CENTER PERMISSIVES TO INCLUDE LOGIC IN THE PLC THAT WILL CLOSE THE FURTHEST UPSTREAM MAINLINE VALVE OF THE FACILITY PIPING IF ANY FACILITY ESDS GO INTO A CLOSED STATUS.  THIS WILL STOP THE SUPPLIER'S FEED INTO THE FACILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SITUATION AND ENSURE THAT THE FACILITY'S PRVS WILL NOT CONTINUOUSLY VENT TO THE ATMOSPHERE.",1476.0,1.0,340.0,80.88235294117648,1.0,0.0,0.0,12.07,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FAILURE SPECIMEN CONCLUDED ""THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY LONGITUDINAL STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC).  THE RUPTURE INITIATED AT A LONGITUDIANL STRESS-CORROSION CRACK IN THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE (HAZ) OF THE LONGITUDINAL ERW SEAM.  THE STRESS-CORROSION CRACK CONSISTED OF SEVERAL SHORTER CRACKS THAT COALESCED TO FORM ONE CRACK THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.2 INCHES LONG.  THE MAXIMUM DEPTH OF THE CRACK WAS 0.219 INCH, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 87.6% OF THE NOMINAL PIPE WALL THICKNESS OF 0.250 INCH.  IN CROSS SECTIONS THROUGH THE SCC CRACK AT THE FAILURE ORIGIN, THE PRESENCE OF SMALL TUNNELS IN THE PIPE STEEL NEAR THE FAILURE ORIGIN, OTHER CRACKS, AND EXTERNAL CORROSION PITS SUGGESTED THAT MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION (MIC) MAY HAVE OCCURRED.

IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT CM-22 WAS LEAKING WITHIN A CASED RAILROAD CROSSING PARALLEL TO US HWY 82 NEAR NEW BOSTON TEXAS.  THE TEAM CLOSED THE HWY TEMPORARILY WHILE THE LINE WAS ISOLATED AND BLOWN DOWN. THE ROAD WAS CLOSED AT 2:20 PM AND REOPENED AT 4:30 PM. A NEW BORE WAS PERFORMED AND THE FINAL TIE-INS WERE COMPLETED 1/22/2019. WHEN THE CARRIER PIPE WAS REMOVED THE PIPE WAS THOROUGHLY CLEANED AND INSPECTED, AND NO CORROSION WAS OBSERVED ON THE PIPE. DUE TO THIS, IT IS ASSUMED THERE IS A SMALL PINHOLE LEAK IN A WELD SOMEWHERE ON THE PIPE. THE PIPE WILL HAVE END CAPS WELDED ON AND PRESSURED UP TO DETERMINE WHERE THE LEAK IS COMING FROM.    AN INITIAL CALL WAS PLACE TO THE NRC ON 1/18/2019 @ 16:50 (NRC# 1235534) AND A 48 HOUR FOLLOW UP WAS PLACED ON 1/20/2019 @ 08:26 (NRC# 1235618).

STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY NOTIFIED OF THE OBSERVATION AT 09:10 ON JANUARY 18.    UPDATE TO PART H - THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE CLOSURE LEAKED DUE TO FAILURE OF THE CLOSURE DOOR O-RING, COUPLED WITH EXCESSIVE GLAND DEPTH AT THE 6:00 ORIENTATION. HOWEVER, AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE GLAND DEPTH HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO MEET THE MANUFACTURER'S DESIGN SPECIFICATION AT THE 6:00 ORIENTATION, AND THE ROOT CAUSE IS TIED TO THE O-RING PERFORMANCE. THE INSTALLED O-RING WAS SIZED CORRECTLY AND OF A MATERIAL COMPATIBLE WITH THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA PRODUCT IN THE PIPELINE. ACCORDING TO THE OEM SUPPLIER, THE REDUCED NON-OEM O-RING DIMENSIONS RESULTING FROM COMPRESSION SET AND SHRINKAGE IS LIKELY FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.

THE L3006, L3028, AND L3082 WERE SHUTOFF AT THE KEYSTONE FIELD VALVE YARD.  L1115 WAS OPENED AT GOLDSMITH TO DIVERT THE GAS NORTH TOWARDS PLAINS.  ONCE THE WARREN WADDELL INTERCONNECT SHUTDOWN, L3146 VALVE 2 WAS OPENED, AND WINK WAS BROUGHT ONLINE, L1105 VALVE 0 WAS CLOSED.  THESE TWO VALVE CLOSURES ISOLATE THE KEYSTONE CS SUCTION PIPING.  - AT 10:01AM, KEYSTORE STARTED INJECTION  - GAS CONTROL CALLED PERMIAN PRODUCERS ASKING THEM TO SHUT IN EARLY  - AT 10:27AM, THE EPNG OPERATIONS SPECIALIST WAS SENT TO LINE 3026 TO CLOSE VALVE 3.   - AT 10:14AM, A SECOND EPNG OPERATIONS SPECIALIST OPENED LINE 1115 TO ALLOW GAS TO FLOW NORTH TO PLAINS.  BY 11:25AM, ALL OF THE RELIEF VALVES HAD RESEATED AND PRESSURES RETURNED TO BELOW MAOP BY 12:16PM.  THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A FAILURE OF CLEAR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EPNG OPERATIONS AND THE CONTROL CENTER.

EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON CHEYENNE HAD EXPERIENCED A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM THAT INCLUDED LARGE AMOUNTS OF RAIN AND HAIL. THE HAIL ACCUMULATED SO QUICKLY ON THE EXTERNAL FLOATING ROOF OF TANK 73 THAT THE ROOF DRAIN SUMP WAS FROZEN OVER RESULTING IN THE ROOF DRAIN BECOMING PLUGGED AND NOT ALLOWING ANY WATER TO DRAIN FROM THE ROOF. HAIL AND RAIN CONTINUED TO COLLECT ON THE ROOF ADDING EXCESS WEIGHT CAUSING THE ROOF TO BEGIN TO SINK. AS THE ROOF BEGAN TO SINK CRUDE OIL BEGAN MIGRATING ONTO THE ROOF THROUGH THE LEG PORTS ADDING MORE WEIGHT. ONCE THE CRUDE OIL CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE FROZEN HAIL IT BEGAN MELTING ALLOWING BOTH WATER AND CRUDE OIL TO DRAIN ONTO THE GROUND AROUND THE TANK RELEASING APPROXIMATELY 500 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM WAS ABLE TO CLOSE THE DRAIN VALVE STOPPING THE FLOW ONTO THE GROUND, VACUUM TRUCKS WERE ONSITE, CONTINUED TO REMOVE THE WATER AND OIL FROM THE CONTAINMENT AREA UNTIL IT HAD BEEN COMPLETELY REMOVED.    THE FOLLOWING MORNING ON JULY 14, 2014 A DECISION WAS MADE TO DRAIN THE BALANCE OF THE WATER AND OIL FROM THE TOP OF THE ROOF TO AVOID ANY FURTHER DAMAGE IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT RAIN WHICH WAS FORECASTED FOR LATER IN THE DAY. THE ROOF DRAIN WAS OPENED AND APPROXIMATELY 1,000 BBLS WAS DRAINED IN A CONTROLLED SETTING WITH VACUUM TRUCKS PRESENT FOR IMMEDIATE RECOVERY.    DUE TO THE HEAVY RAINS PRIOR TO THE RELEASE THE GROUND IN THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT AREA WAS SATURATED AND THE OIL FLOATED ON THE WATER UNTIL IT WAS REMOVED. THIS RESULTED IN VERY LITTLE GROUND CONTAMINATION FROM THE CRUDE OIL. AFTER THE ROOF WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED IT WAS CLEANED AND INSPECTED AND FOUND TO HAVE SUSTAINED NO DAMAGE AND IT WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON JULY 15, 2014 AND 100% OF THE RELEASE WAS CONTAINED IN THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT AREA RESULTING IN NO HAZARDS TO HUMAN HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

DISTRICT STATION, R-316, CONTINUES TO BE OUT OF COMMISSION. A TEMPORARY REGULATOR STATION HAS BEEN INSTALLED TO ENSURE SAFE, RELIABLE SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS DURING WINTER OPERATIONS.   CURRENTLY SERVICE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS.     COLUMBIA'S CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS FIRE WAS THE RESULT OF A CROSS ARM FAILURE FROM OUR ELECTRICAL PROVIDER'S NEARBY POWER POLE.  THE HIGH VOLTAGE PRIMARY CONDUCTORS (LINES) FELL INTO THE SECONDARY ELECTRICAL DROP SERVING COLUMBIA'S REGULATOR STATION BUILDING AND ENERGIZED THE NEUTRAL TO 7200 VOLTS.  THIS RESULTED IN A FAULT CURRENT THAT TRAVELED VIA ALL AVAILABLE GROUND PATHS TO STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES LOCATED INSIDE THE STATION.

ATMOS ENERGY CREWS RESPONDED BY MAKING THE AREA SAFE, EVACUATING THE HIGH SCHOOL, AND THEN BEGAN THE PROCESS OF RESTORING SERVICE TO THE HIGH SCHOOL.  THE MAIN LINE IN THE AREA CONSISTED OF 4"" STEEL PIPE.  HOWEVER, THE REPAIR REQUIRED THE INSTALLATION OF A POLY TRANSITION FITTING FROM THE STEEL MAIN TO THE 3"" STEEL SERVICE LINE AS WELL AS THE INSTALLATION OF A POLY VALVE.  A BELL HOLE WAS DUG AT THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE AND WHERE THE MAIN TO SERVICE LINE CONNECTION WAS BEING REPLACED. ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, REPAIRS HAD BEEN COMPLETED ON THE SEGMENT OF MAIN UP TO THE CLOSED POLY VALVE AND WAS ACTIVE WITH NATURAL GAS. ATMOS ENERGY EMPLOYEES WERE PREPARING TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE SERVICE LINE WHEN NATURAL GAS SUDDENLY ESCAPED AND IGNITED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:20 A.M.  TWO EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED AND WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.  ONE EMPLOYEE WAS TREATED AND RELEASED, AND THE OTHER WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL AT 11:17 AM.      THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE AND RELEASE OF THE 4"" ELECTROFUSION COUPLING THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THE NORTH BELL HOLE.  THE JOINT FAILURE WAS SUDDEN AND OCCURRED AFTER THE COUPLING WAS  INSTALLED AND PLACED IN SERVICE.  THE JOINT FAILURE AND SEPARATION OF THE COUPLING OCCURRED WITHIN THE SAME EXCAVATED BELL HOLE THAT THE RESULTING INJURED CREW MEMBERS WERE WORKING DOWNSTREAM PERFORMING FINAL SYSTEM TIE-INS.      THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF IGNITION OCCURRED FROM THE ENERGIZED FITTING BEING FUSED (4"" EF COUPLING) ON THE OUTLET SIDE OF THE VALVE.

WITH A VIABLE BACKUP LINE AVAILABLE, STOPPED DIGGING FOR THE WEEKEND AND INITIATED A PLAN TO FLUSH THE LINE CLEAR WITH FIREWATER SATURDAY MORNING.  ON TUESDAY (3 SEPT) GREEN DYE WAS INJECTED AND THE LINE PRESSURED-UP TO 50 PSIG.  A CRACK IN A CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELD OF A 45-DEGREE ELBOW WAS EVENTUALLY IDENTIFIED AS THE LEAK LOCATION.    IMMEDIATE MITIGATION PLAN WAS TO MAKE A TEMPORARY REPAIR BY INSTALLING AN ENGINEERED BOLTED ENCLOSURE DUE TO THE PLAN TO ASSESS THE ENTIRE PIPELINE USING ILI TECHNOLOGY SCHEDULED FOR 2020.  PERMANENT REPAIR BY REPLACING THE FAILED SECTION WAS PLANNED POST ILI ACTIVITIES.    HOWEVER, THE ENGINEERED BOLTED ENCLOSURE WOULD NOT SEAL.  THEREFORE, ~10 LINEAR FEET OF PIPING AND (2) 45-DEGREE ELBOWS WERE REMOVED AND REPLACED.  ALL REPLACED PIPING AND FITTINGS WERE SAND BLASTED AND RE-COATED USING SP-2888 (EPOXY-URETHANE COATING).  AFTER ALL REPAIRS WERE MADE, A HYDROTEST WAS PERFORMED ON 100% OF THE PIPELINE.  THE FOLLOWING NONDESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATIONS WERE ALSO PERFORMED:  A. 100% VISUAL ANALYSIS  B. 100% RADIOGRAPHIC TESTING  C. 10% DYE PENETRANT TESTING     PEI ENGINEER AND PEI CORROSION AND MATERIALS SPECIALIST DEVELOPED A PLAN TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE PIPING.  THE PLAN WAS TO RECEIVE THE FAILED SECTION OF THE PIPE, TAKE AS-RECEIVED PHOTOS, BLAST THE FAILED SECTION (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL), PERFORM VISUAL ANALYSIS AND DYE PENETRANT EXAMINATION IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK LOCATION.  AFTER VISUAL ANALYSIS, DYE PENETRANT TESTING WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF CRACKING IN THE LEAK LOCATION AS WELL AS SIMILAR LOCATIONS IN THE AREA OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELD.  TESTING INDICATED THE CRACK WAS ISOLATED TO THE AREA OF THE LEAK LOCATION.  NO OTHER CRACKING WAS FOUND.    IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS A DEFECTIVE WELD IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK LOCATION RESULTING IN A STRESS RISER FROM WHICH A LONGITUDINAL CRACK PROPAGATED.  THE LONGITUDINAL CRACK PROPAGATED DUE TO CIRCUMFERENTIAL STRESS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CAUSES:    A. BENDING STRESS DUE TO MISALIGNMENT.    B. OUT-OF-ROUNDNESS EXHIBITED BY SIGNIFICANT HIGH-LOW.  C. HOOP STRESS GENERATED BY NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE.    TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE 16"" DOCK LINE, MOTIVA HAS THE FOLLOWING CURRENT PLAN IN PLACE:   1.  ILI (INLINE INSPECTION) IN 2020.  2.  PERFORM HYDROSTATIC TEST IN CONJUNCTION WITH ILI.  3.  PERFORM INTEGRITY RISK ASSESSMENTS EVERY 5 YEARS.  4.  PERFORM ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION INSPECTIONS EVERY 3 YEARS.  5.  CATHODIC PROTECTION MONITORED BI-MONTHLY RECTIFIER TEST.  6.

(UIS) WAS CONTRACTED TO DIRECT AND COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION ON THE GAS FIRED HEATER INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED ON 2/28/14.  UIS COORDINATED THE REMOVAL OF THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPING FROM THE GAS FIRED HEATER ON 4/1/14.  AN INTACT EXEMPLAR PIPE SECTION FROM A LOWER ELEVATION WITHIN THE GAS FIRED HEATER WAS ALSO REMOVED AT THE SAME TIME TO BE ANALYZED WITH THE FAILED SECTION.  THE SAMPLES WERE SENT TO FORENSIC CONSULTANTS GROUP, LLC (FCG) IN DENVER, CO TO EVALUATE THE FAILED PIPE SECTION AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT MATERIAL SELECTION, PRE-EXISTING DAMAGE, USER ERROR, OPERATING CONDITIONS, AND/OR DESIGN/MANUFACTURING DEFECTS CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED FAILURE.    FCG FINDING:  - THE ""FISHMOUTH"" TYPE RUPTURE IN THE SPOOL PIECE SHOWED EXTENSIVE DEFORMATION AND THINNING TYPICAL OF A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM OVERHEAT FAILURE.  - EXTENSIVE SECONDARY CRACKING WAS NOTED IN BOTH THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SPOOL PIECE AND IN THE SPOOL PIECE MATERIAL ITSELF.  THE PRESENCE OF THE EXTENSIVE SECONDARY CRACKING ALONG WITH THE CRACKING THAT LED TO THE FAILURE SHOWS THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A UNIFORM CONDITION IN THE PIPING SUCH AS EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, OR INADEQUATE WALL THICKNESS RATHER THAN AN ISOLATED DEFECT.  - THE ULTIMATE FAILURE OF THE SPOOL PIECE WAS CAUSED BY ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE THINNING OF THE TUBE WALL AND THE INITIATION AND GROWTH OF CREEP CRACKS TO THE POINT WHERE THE REMAINING CROSS SECTION COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE INTERNAL GAS PRESSURE.  - THE RESULTS OF THE OPTICAL EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY (OES) OF THE MATERIAL SHOWED THAT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION WAS WITHIN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SA106 GRADE B MATERIAL.  - THE RESULTS OF THE TENSILE TESTS INDICATE THAT THE SPOOL PIECE AND THE ADJACENT PIPING MATERIAL MET THE MECHANICAL PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS OF SA106 GRADE B MATERIAL.  WBI HAS ANALYZED THE FINDINGS IN THE FCG REPORT AND HAVE INITIATED TAKING SEVERAL STEPS TO PREVENT THIS INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN ON THE REPLACEMENT UNIT AND ON EXISTING UNITS.   DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW GAS FIRED HEATER, WBI WILL REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURE OF THE GAS FIRED HEATER TO BE ONSITE FOR THE STARTUP/COMMISSIONING AND VERIFICATION OF ALL LOGIC, SYSTEM INTERLOCKS, AND SHUTDOWNS.  ADDITIONAL SHUTDOWNS WILL BE ADDED TO THE LOGIC INCLUDING A SHUTDOWN REQUIRING THE REGEN COMPRESSOR TO BE IN A RUN STATE FOR THE GAS FIRED HEATER TO BE IN OPERATION AND A SECONDARY DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SHUTDOWN DEVICE WILL BE ADDED TO MEASURE FLOW GOING INTO THE GAS FIRED HEATER AND SHUTDOWN ON LOW FLOW CONDITIONS.     IN ADDITION TO THE STEPS WBI WILL TAKE ON THE REPLACEMENT GAS FIRED HEATER UNIT, WBI WILL ALSO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH OUR EXISTING UNITS TO CONFIRM THEY ARE IN SATISFACTORY OPERATIONAL CONDITION.    PRIOR TO THE END OF 2014 WBI WILL:    - DEVELOP A PLAN TO VERIFY THE INTEGRITY OF THE TUBING BUNDLES TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF TUBE SWELLING AND CRACKING AND FULLY IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN WITHIN 12 MONTHS,   - ESTABLISH CRITERIA AND VERIFY THAT SYSTEM SHUTDOWNS OCCUR QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE FROM OCCURRING IN THE CASE OF A UNIT MALFUNCTION, AND  - INSPECT AND CALIBRATE ALL GAS FIRED HEATER EQUIPMENT.    WBI WILL STANDARDIZE THE INSPECTION AND CALIBRATION FORM AND REQUIRE THAT ALL STATIONS INSPECT AND CALIBRATE ALL GAS FIRED HEATER EQUIPMENT ANNUALLY; AND WBI WILL IMPLEMENT THE DEVELOPED INSPECTION PLAN OF THE TUBING BUNDLES TO BE DONE EVERY THREE YEARS.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE WORK ON UNIT 3, THE TECHNICIAN NOTICED STAINED GRAVEL AROUND A BURIED DRAIN VALVE ON THE SUCTION SIDE OF UNIT 1.  SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AROUND THE DRAIN VALVE.  SHEARED BOLTS WERE OBSERVED ON THE BODY OF THE VALVE WHICH CAUSED THE VALVE TO SEPARATE AND LEAK.  THE STATION WAS ISOLATED AND SKILLETS WERE INSTALLED AROUND THE VALVE TO STOP THE LEAK. APPROXIMATELY 40 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WERE REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATED AREA.  THE IMPACTED SOIL WAS SET ASIDE FOR DISPOSAL.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT ENTERED THE SUB-SURFACE DRAIN WHICH LEADS TO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR.  ON JANUARY 8, 2014 CREWS EXCAVATED IMPACTED SOILS AROUND THE AFFECTED SUB-SURFACE DRAIN LINES.  WATER WAS USED TO FLUSH 73 GALLONS OF RESIDUAL PRODUCT FROM THE DRAIN LINE INTO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR.  PRODUCT COLLECTED FROM THE EXCAVATION AND OIL/WATER SEPARATOR WAS RETURNED TO THE SYSTEM VIA THE STATION SUMP.   IMPACTS TO THE DRAIN SYSTEM AND SURFICIAL SOILS WERE ADDRESSED.  FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES WERE SCHEDULED TO CONFIRM THAT NO PRODUCT REMAINED IN THE SUBSURFACE DRAIN SYSTEM AND EVALUATE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER IMPACTS AT DEPTH BELOW THE EXCAVATION AROUND THE VALVE.    ON JANUARY 10, 2014 A VAC TRUCK AND CREW BEGAN INSTALLING BORINGS IN THE AREA OF THE VALVE TO ASSESS ADDITIONAL IMPACTS AT DEPTH.  TWO BORINGS BENEATH THE RELEASE AREA REVEALED FREE PRODUCT IN A SANDY LAYER OF SOIL APPROXIMATELY 11 FEET DEEP.  THE VAC TRUCK INSERTED STINGER PIPES INTO THE BORINGS AND REMOVED THE FREE PRODUCT.  SEVERE WEATHER WAS ANTICIPATED AND THE BORINGS WERE ALLOWED TO RECHARGE TO SEE IF PRODUCT RETURNED.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 25 BORINGS INSTALLED BY HAND AND VAC TRUCK THE WEEK OF JANUARY 13.  NRC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE ON JANUARY 15 AT 10:53 (REPORT #1071203) WHEN ANTICIPATED COSTS EXCEEDED THE COST REPORTING $50,000 REPORTING THRESHOLD.  SOUTH CAROLINA DHEC WAS NOTIFIED ON JANUARY 15 AT 11:00.  PRODUCT RECOVERY OPERATIONS RAMPED UP OVER THE WEEK OF JANUARY 13 TO INCLUDE VACUUM EXTRACTION OF PRODUCT FROM 8 RECOVERY WELLS INSTALLED ACROSS THE MANIFOLD YARD AND A RECOVERY TRENCH INSTALLED JUST ADJACENT TO THE YARD.  A STREAM LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 400 TO 500 FEET FROM THE MANIFOLD YARD IS BEING MONITORED ON A ROUTINE BASIS EACH DAY.   NO IMPACTS TO THE STREAM HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.   THE EXTENT OF FREE PRODUCT IN THE SUBSURFACE HAS BEEN DELINEATED AND IS CONFINED TO THE MANIFOLD AND AREA JUST DOWNGRADIENT OF THE MANIFOLD WITHIN THE STATION BOUNDARIES.  SOIL IMPACTS APPEAR TO BE MINIMAL AND WERE LIMITED TO THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE VALVE.  NO OFF SITE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.  ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES ARE CONTINUING WITH THE INSTALLATION OF MONITORING AND RECOVERY WELLS.  PRODUCT RECOVERY OPERATIONS ARE CONTINUING.       2/18/14 UPDATE:  RELEASE VOLUME ESTIMATE ADJUSTED TO 52,000 GALLONS.  THIS VOLUME IS BASED UPON PRELIMINARY DATA FROM WHICH AN ESTIMATED RELEASE DATE AND DURATION WERE CALCULATED.  AS ADDITIONAL DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE THE RELEASE VOLUME MAY BE ADJUSTED.  ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS WERE ALSO ADJUSTED TO ACCOMMODATE LONGER TERM ANTICIPATED EXPENDITURES.  APPROXIMATELY 34,500 GALLONS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE GROUNDWATER REMEDIATION SYSTEM INSTALLED AT THE SITE.  MONITORING OF GROUNDWATER WELLS INSTALLED AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE FACILITY INDICATE THE RELEASED PRODUCT IS CONFINED TO THE FACILITY PROPERTY.  2/10/2015 FINAL UPDATE:  THE FINAL RELEASE VOLUME ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 52,000 GALLONS.  A TOTAL OF 44,000 GALLONS OF PRODUCT HAVE BEEN RECOVERED UTILIZING ORIGINAL PUMP/REMEDIATION SYSTEM.

AS PART OF THE PREPAREDNESS OPERATIONS, THE FACILITY WAS SWITCHED TO GENERATOR POWER TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OPERATIONS SHOULD THERE BE A LOSS OF COMMERCIAL POWER.  DURING THE POWER TRANSFER, THE AUTO TRANSFER SWITCH DID NOT CHANGE OVER QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE ESD SYSTEM FROM SENSING A POWER LOSS.  AS A RESULT, THE ESD SYSTEM ACTUATED AND BLEW DOWN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING PIPING.  WITH GENERATOR POWER ONLINE, THE OPERATOR RESET THE ESD AND STARTED COMPRESSOR C.  HOWEVER, AN AUTOMATED BLOWDOWN VALVE REQUIRED FOR THE ESD ON COMPRESSOR C FAILED TO CLOSE TO 100% DESPITE THE VALVE CLOSE LIMIT INDICATOR SHOWED CLOSED. THE ESD ACTIVATED DETECTION SYSTEM AT THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER DID NOT ACTIVATE DUE TO THE LOW FLOW RATE OF GAS AT THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER.  THE OPERATOR ON SHIFT NOTICED GAS VAPORS COMING OUT OF THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER AT 8:30 PM.  THE OPERATOR CALLED THE I&E TECH. AT 8:30 PM 9/13/21 TO NOTIFY HIM OF THE VAPORS COMING OUT OF THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER.  THE I&E TECH WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO WORK TO STAY THE NIGHT FOR THE STORM.   WHEN THE I&E TECH ARRIVED, THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE SMALL, AND WAS TOO DANGEROUS WITH WINDS, RAIN, AND LIGHTING TO INVESTIGATE THE LEAK. ONCE THE STORM PASSED AT 8:30 AM THE I&E TECH DISCOVERED THE PARTIALLY OPEN BLOWDOWN VALVE AND COMPLETELY CLOSED IT.  THIS FAILURE TO HAVE 100% CLOSURE RESULTED IN NATURAL GAS ESCAPING THROUGH THE VENT OUT OF THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER. DURING  A REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM BALANCE ANALYSIS EQUATIONS FOUND THAT ENOUGH GAS MAY  HAD BEEN RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE TO TRIGGER REPORTING.

THE REGIONS OF THE PIPE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE FAILURE INITIATION REGION DID NOT EXHIBIT PITTING CORROSION, INDICATING THAT THE INITIAL REGION OF COATING DAMAGE WAS SMALL AND LOCALIZED.    10/1/2019 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT  PART G.5.1 UPDATED TO DETERMINED BY METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS   PART G.5.3 UPDATED TO STRESS CORROSION CRACKING  PART H NARRATIVE UPDATED TO INCLUDE METALLURGICAL RESULTS",18103.0,0.0,780.0,96.15384615384616,1.0,1.0,0.0,25.775,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(CPL) EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED A LEAK FROM TANK- ASSOCIATED PIPING WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF CPL'S CRANE STATION. APPROXIMATELY 230 BARRELS OF OIL WERE RELEASED, ALL ON COMPANY OWNED AND CONTROLLED PROPERTY, 218 BARRELS OF WHICH WERE RECOVERED IN LIQUID FORM. THE REMAINDER WAS ADDRESSED THROUGH SOIL REMEDIATION AND NO NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS REMAIN. NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES OCCURRED.    CPL DETERMINED, THROUGH A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, THAT THE APPARENT FAILURE CAUSE IS INTERNAL CORROSION DUE TO MICROBIOLOGICALLY INDUCED CORROSION (MIC). CPL IDENTIFIED LOCALIZED PITTING AND DETERMINED THE PIT MORPHOLOGY IS INDICATIVE OF MIC.    AS BACKGROUND, THE FAILED PIPE IS ABOVEGROUND PIPING ASSOCIATED WITH A TANK IN THE CRANE STATION.  ALL BELOW GROUND STATION PIPING HAS ACTIVE CATHODIC PROTECTION (CP); THE ASSOCIATED TANK ALSO HAS ACTIVE CP, ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM IS SEPARATE FROM THE BELOWGROUND PIPING SYSTEM.  THE FAILED ABOVEGROUND PIPE SEGMENT DID NOT HAVE ACTIVE CP SINCE CP IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THIS CONFIGURATION.  HOWEVER, ALL OIL IN THIS SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE FAILED SEGMENT, IS TREATED WITH CORROSION INHIBITOR. FURTHER, BIOCIDE IS ADDED TO THE OIL WITHIN THE ASSOCIATED TANK.    IN RESPONSE TO THIS EVENT, CPL WILL BE ADDING A COUPON IN THE STATION PIPING THE WEEK OF APRIL 6, 2020.

THE CREW CONSISTED OF A DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER AND A SERVICE TECHNICIAN. THE CREW EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED A 6-INCH CAST IRON DISTRIBUTION MAIN OPERATING AT 5 PSIG.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER, WHILE WEARING A SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR, PREPARED THE CAST IRON MAIN FOR INSTALLATION OF A 6-INCH BY 9-INCHES IN LENGTH PIPE REPAIR CLAMP.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER INSTALLED THE CLAMP AND TIGHTENED THE BOLTS TO STOP THE LEAK.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER REMOVED THE SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. THEREAFTER, HE PROCEEDED TO FINISH TIGHTENING THE BOLTS AND SOAP CHECK THE PIPE TO VERIFY THAT THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.  AT THAT TIME, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN LEFT THE TOP OF THE EXCAVATION AND WENT TO THE TRUCK TO RETRIEVE COATING FOR THE REPAIR CLAMP WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF GAS BLOWING FROM THE EXCAVATION.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE EXCAVATION AND FOUND THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER KNEELING FACE DOWN OVER THE GAS MAIN AND UNRESPONSIVE TO VERBAL COMMANDS.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO AND CALLED 911.  GROSSE POINTE FARMS POLICE AND EMS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PULLED THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION; HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IN DETROIT, MI WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD.  A SECOND REPAIR CREW WAS CALLED IN TO REPAIR THE GAS MAIN FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND INSTALLED A 6-INCH BY 12-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP ADJACENT TO THE FIRST REPAIR CLAMP;  HOWEVER THE CLAMP FURTHER CRUSHED THE CORRODED/WEAKENED PIPE.   BOTH REPAIR CLAMPS WERE REMOVED AND A 6-INCH BY 30-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE LEAK.

COLONIAL PERSONNEL AND A CONTRACT CREW RESPONDED AND BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE AREA AROUND THE ACCESS WELL.  THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE PROVER CLOSURE, WHICH IS LOCATED ABOVE GROUND IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACCESS WELL WHERE THE PRODUCT WAS DISCOVERED.  THE CLOSURE WAS TIGHTENED AND PRESSURE TESTED TO ENSURE A POSITIVE SEAL. ALL SITE WORK INCLUDING EXCAVATION AND CLEANUP WERE COMPLETED BY 28 OCTOBER 2014. NO IMMEDIATE AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS WERE REQUIRED BASED ON THE VOLUME OF THE RELEASE.    INCIDENT ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT ON TUESDAY, 10/21/14, THE PROVER HAD BEEN ISOLATED AND DRAINED FOR A CUP INSPECTION. THE PROVER HAS A THREADED CLOSURE WHICH REQUIRES THE USE OF A SLEDGEHAMMER AND HYDRAULIC JACK TO CLOSE COMPLETELY. UPON COMPLETION OF THE INSPECTION, THE PROVER WAS NOT COMPLETELY SEALED AND LEAK TESTED. TWO TECHNICIANS USED THEIR BODY WEIGHT ON THE CLOSURE BUT DID NOT USE THE SLEDGEHAMMER AND JACK. THE PLAN WAS TO LEAVE THE PROVER ISOLATED AND DRAINED, THEN REPLACE THE CUPS TWO DAYS LATER.

SYSTEM CONTROL HAD ARRANGED FOR ALTERNATIVE GAS SUPPLIES AND ADVISED THE REPAIR CREW TO HOLD OFF ON THE PURGE UNTIL 6:30.  THE CREW RETURNED TO THE REPAIR SITE AT 6:15 AND AT 6:34 BEGAN THE PURGE.  THE PURGE WAS COMPLETED AT 7:04 AND THE PACK BEGAN AT 7:05.  THE PIPELINE EQUALIZED AT 8:19 AT 600#.  ALL VALVES WERE PUT BACK IN THE NORMAL OPERATING POSITIONS AND CONTROL OF THE PIPELINE WAS TURNED OVER TO SYSTEM CONTROL AT 8:40.    THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED WAS SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE CONCLUSION IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE LEAK WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PREVIOUS MECHANICAL DAMAGE.  THE LEAK ORIGINATED AT A CRACK MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 5 1/2 INCHES LONG LOCATED WITHIN A 9-INCH LONG GOUGE.  THE GOUGE WAS ORIENTED AT APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES TO THE AXIS OF THE PIPE.

THE DEVICE WAS DISCOVERED ABOVE TWO BURIED PIPELINES (A PG&E NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE AND A MOJAVE WATER DISTRICT PIPELINE) AND THE PIPELINE ROUTE WAS CLEARLY MARKED AS SHARED BY PG&E AND THE MOJAVE WATER DISTRICT. THE PG&E EMPLOYEE MOVED THE DEVICE ABOUT 2,000 FEET ALONG THE ROAD, TO A LOCATION ABOVE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY SHARED BY PG&E AND THE KINDER MORGAN COMPANY, PRIOR TO REPORTING THE DEVICE TO HIS SUPERVISOR.  THE SUPERVISOR THEN REPORTED THE MATTER TO PG&E'S CORPORATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT AND THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PATROL DEPUTY ARRIVED ON SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 0930 HOURS.  UPON SEEING THE DEVICE, THE DEPUTY ESTABLISHED A ONE MILE PERIMETER AROUND THE DEVICE'S LOCATION, INSTRUCTED HINKLEY COMPRESSOR STATION EMPLOYEES TO SHELTER IN PLACE, AND CALLED THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BOMB SQUAD.  PG&E'S CORPORATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT DISPATCHED AN INVESTIGATOR TO THE SCENE WHO ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH HINKLEY COMPRESSOR STATION AND SAN BERNARDINO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.  BOMB SQUAD PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1300 HOURS.  THE BOMB SQUAD EXAMINED THE DEVICE, THEN REMOVED IT TO A SAFE AREA NEARBY AND RENDERED IT SAFE AT APPROXIMATELY 1345 HOURS.   PG&E'S CORPORATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT WAS ADVISED SHORTLY THEREAFTER THAT THE SHERIFF'S BOMB TECHNICIANS DECLARED IT WAS A FUNCTIONAL DEVICE, WHICH COULD HAVE EXPLODED IF IT HAD AN OUTSIDE POWER SOURCE, WHICH IT LACKED.  THE DEVICE WAS DESCRIBED AS A PVC PIPE, ABOUT TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER, SEVERAL INCHES LONG, WITH END CAPS ATTACHED.   THE SAN BERNARDINO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ADVISED THE DEVICE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO AFFECT THE PIPES HAD IT EXPLODED ABOVE THEM.  CORPORATE SECURITY COMMUNICATED THE DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT TO THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AND THE RIVERSIDE RESIDENT AGENCY OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.   FROM DECEMBER 10 TO 11, PG&E RE-INSPECTED THE PIPELINE L-314 ROUTE, ALONG WITH OTHER PG&E PIPELINE ROUTES IN THE AREA, TO LOOK FOR OTHER DEVICES.  NO OTHER DEVICES WERE DISCOVERED.

THE CRUDE BLEND SYSTEM WAS SHUT DOWN AND THE VALVE WAS CLOSED TO ISOLATE THE LEAK.  NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS WERE INITIATED TO CONTAIN AND CLEAN UP THE SPILL.       MAINTENANCE DISCOVERED THAT A 1/4 INCH NIPPLE ON THE BOTTOM PLATE OF A 12 INCH GTS VALVE HAD CORRODED AND BLOWN OUT OF THE VALVE. THE THREADS ON THE VALVE PLATE APPEARED TO NOT ENGAGE PROPERLY WHEN REPLACED WITH A NEW 1/4 INCH NIPPLE.  METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE NIPPLE CONFIRMED THAT THE NIPPLE HAD CORRODED FROM BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CORROSION.  BASED ON THIS AND THE OBVERVATIONS IN THE FIELD AFTER THE INCIDENT, IT IS LIKELY THE VALVE PLATE THREADS WERE DEFECTIVE, AND THE NIPPLE THREADS DID NOT ENGAGE PROPERLY IN THE VALVE THUS CAUSING SOME CRUDE TO LEAK INTO THE THREAD AREA AND START CORROSION.      FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION, THE THREADS ON THE BOTTOM PLATE WERE DRILLED OUT AND ENLARGED TO 1/2 INCH TO ENSURE THE NIPPLE WOULD PROPERLY ENGAGE WITH THE THREADS.  A NEW 1/2 INCH NIPPLE WAS INSTALLED.

THE EVENT SITE IS NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF CLARKSVILLE HWY AND HWY 12.    THERE WERE NO NOTED INJURIES OR FATALITIES FROM THIS EVENT.  THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED AREA RESIDENCES.  LANE CLOSURES DID OCCUR DUE TO DEBRIS FROM ESCAPING GAS. DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED TO AREA STRUCTURES DUE TO DEBRIS FROM THE FORCE OF THE ESCAPING GAS.  THE PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 620 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT.    GAS CONTROL NOTED THE EVENT DUE TO SCADA ALARMS.  NOTIFICATION WAS ALSO RECEIVED BY THE CALL CENTER FROM LOCAL RESIDENCES.  FIRST RESPONDERS WERE DISPATCHED BY BOTH GROUPS.

NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO BOTH THE TENNESSEE REGULATORY AUTHORITY (TRA) AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER BASED ON INITIAL ESTIMATES THAT COST WOULD EXCEED $50,000 FOR REPAIRS INCLUDING COST OF LOST GAS.    SIX RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER PREMISES WERE IMPACTED BY THE CLOSURE OF THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE.  ALL IMPACTED CUSTOMERS WERE CONTACTED TO INFORM THEM OF THE SITUATION AND EXPECTATION OF OUTAGE TIMELINES.

ON TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16TH AT 14:24, DURING AN ON-SITE VISUAL INSPECTION, LOCAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL DISCOVERED A RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL. THE SANTA RITA STATION WAS SHUT IN PRIOR TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WINTER STORM ON STATEWIDE ELECTRICAL DELIVERY.     THE SANTA RITA STATION LOST POWER IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ON FEB. 15 AND CONTINUED TO BE WITHOUT POWER UNTIL FEB 19. THE SANTA RITA STATION WAS OBSERVED BY MEDALLION'S CONTROL CENTER UNTIL COMMUNICATION WITH THE STATION WAS LOST DUE TO THE DEPLETION OF ITS BACKUP POWER SOURCE. MEDALLION THEN INITIATED ON-SITE VISUAL STATION INSPECTIONS. THE FIRST STATION CHECK OCCURRED ON FEB. 15TH AT 10:30 AND NO RELEASE WAS OBSERVED. DURING A SUBSEQUENT STATION CHECK ON FEB. 16TH AT 14:20, THE RELEASE WAS OBSERVED AND WAS REPORTED INTERNALLY.    ADDITIONAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT 15:10 ON FEB 16 AND CONFIRMED THE RELEASE AS A REPORTABLE ACCIDENT. THE RELEASE WAS NOT ACTIVE AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY. CRUDE OIL WAS OBSERVED INSIDE THE CONCRETE CONTAINMENT SKID THAT HOUSED PUMP 9620. AN INVESTIGATION FOUND THE RELEASE OCCURRED AT A FLANGED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BARREL OF PUMP 9620 AND THE CONNECTING DISCHARGE PIPING. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE SEVERE COLD TEMPERATURE IN COMBINATION WITH A LACK OF FLOW IN THE STATION, DUE TO DISRUPTED ELECTRICAL POWER DELIVERY, RESULTED IN CONTRACTION OF THE GASKET MATERIAL AND OR THE CONNECTING PIPING.

NARRATIVE UPDATE 8/11/2017    THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) RELEASED A PIPELINE ACCIDENT BRIEF (PAB) ON 6/15/2017 WHICH PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE CENTREVILLE INCIDENT (PAB-17/01, ADOPTED BY NTSB ON 6/5/2017). AS PROVIDED IN THE PAB, NTSB DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS A ""THROUGHWALL CORROSION FATIGUE THAT DEVELOPED AT A DENT IN THE PIPELINE DUE TO RESIDUAL AND OPERATIONAL STRESS & EXPOSURE TO THE UNDERGROUND ENVIRONMENT"". COLONIAL CONCURS THAT THE CRACK DEVELOPED DUE TO FATIGUE CAUSED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING PRESSURE CYCLING, BUT COLONIAL DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENCE OF CORROSION AT THE FAILURE SITE HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE LEAK OCCURRENCE. CORROSION AT THE LEAK LOCATION WAS TOO LIMITED TO HAVE ANY APPRECIABLE IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND FULL THROUGH-WALL PROPAGATION OF A CRACK.    PHMSA'S ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION DIVISION DIRECTED COLONIAL TO INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC DATES/TIMES AS SET FORTH IN THIS FORM'S PART A #4, #18A, AND #18B.  NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, HOWEVER, COLONIAL MAINTAINS:  (1) AS TO #4 - THE APPROPRIATE DATE/TIME OF THE ACCIDENT (I.E., WHEN 'ACCIDENT REPORTING CRITERIA WAS MET') IS ""9/21/2015  20:53"", WHEN COLONIAL RECEIVED THE CALL FROM THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE MARSHAL REPORTING A SHEEN ON THE RETENTION POND.   (2) AS TO #18A - THE APPROPRIATE DATE/TIME WHEN COLONIAL 'IDENTIFIED THE ACCIDENT' IS ""9/23/2015 09:57"", WHEN COLONIAL CONFIRMED THAT THE RELEASE ORIGINATED FROM ITS PIPELINE.  PRIOR TO THAT TIME, COLONIAL HAD NOT 'IDENTIFIED THE FAILURE' - COLONIAL'S PIPELINES WERE LOCATED SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE POND AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF THE ODORS AND/OR SHEEN.  IN RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF A SHEEN, COLONIAL INITIATED THE SHUTDOWN OF ITS PIPELINE AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, EVEN THOUGH THE SOURCE HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. COLONIAL REPORTED GASOLINE 'FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE' TO THE NRC ON 9/22/2015 AT 01:32. COLONIAL 'IDENTIFIED THE FAILURE' ON 9/23/2015 AT 09:57 WHEN PRODUCT WAS OBSERVED LEAKING FROM COLONIAL'S LINE 4 PIPELINE.  UNTIL THAT TIME, THERE WAS NO DEFINITIVE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SHEEN ON THE RETENTION POND AND COLONIAL'S PIPELINE, WHICH WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE POND.   (3) AS TO #18B - THE APPROPRIATE DATE/TIME WHEN COLONIAL 'RESOURCES ARRIVED ON SITE' IS ""9/23/2015 09:57"".  COLONIAL RESOURCES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE PRIOR TO THAT DATE/TIME, BUT THIS FORM'S INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDE THAT #18B MUST BE CONCURRENT WITH OR LATER THAN #18A (WHEN THE ACCIDENT WAS IDENTIFIED BY COLONIAL).     UPDATE APRIL 2020: DURING THE TIME PERIOD THAT THIS RELEASE OCCURRED, COLONIAL HAD EXPERIENCED SEVERAL OTHER RELEASES THAT HAD THE SAME FAILURE MODE.  THE IA THAT FOLLOWED THIS INCIDENT WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE OTHER RECENT FATIGUE CRACK IN DENT FAILURES, AND WAS ADDRESSED AS ONE COMPREHENSIVE, SYSTEM-WIDE ASSESSMENT OF THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FATIGUE CRACKS IN DENTS.  THIS APPROACH WAS TAKEN BY COLONIAL TO ENSURE THAT THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM ALL OF THE INCIDENTS COULD BE FACTORED INTO THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM-WIDE.     THE IA INCLUDED METALLURGICAL ANALYSES OF THREE OF THE DENT FAILURES, ALL CONFIRMING THAT PRESSURE CYCLING OF THE DENT RESULTED IN THROUGH WALL FATIGUE CRACKS.  THE PRESENCE OF THE DENT CONCENTRATED STRESSES ON THE PIPELINE, CREATING A FATIGUE CRACK TO FORM AND GROW THROUGH-WALL OVER TIME DUE TO PRESSURE CYCLING.",19256.0,1.0,657.0,34.18569254185692,1.0,0.0,0.0,22.67,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

UPON VISUALLY CHECKING THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE, THE CS OPERATOR OBSERVED A CLOUD OF DUST BLOWING INTO ATMOSPHERE.  HE THEN IMMEDIATELY OBSERVED A DROP IN PRESSURE IN LINE 1547 WHICH IS ON THE DISCHARGE SIDE OF THE CS.  THE CS OPERATOR CLOSED THE VALVES TO ISOLATE AND STOP THE FLOW OF MATERIAL THROUGH LINE 1547, THEN CONTACTED THE PROPER COLUMBIA PERSONNEL REQUESTING LOGISTICAL AND LOCATION ASSESSMENT AND CONFIRMATION SUPPORT.

TECHNICIANS WERE DISPATCHED TO VARIOUS AREAS BETWEEN THE STEELE CITY PUMP STATION AND 30 MILES DOWNSTREAM TO DETERMINE/CONFIRM A RELEASE EVENT.  AT 00:15 DECEMBER 8, A CRUDE OIL ODOR WAS DETECTED BY A TCE TECHNICIAN WHICH CONFIRMED DISCOVERY OF A RELEASE AND THE NRC WAS CALLED AT 00:28.      PIPELINE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RESTARTED ON DECEMBER 29 AFTER REPLACEMENT OF FAILED SECTION. MECHANICAL AND METALLURGICAL TESTING ARE BEING PERFORMED BY AN INDEPENDENT TESTING FACILITY, AND A ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS (RCFA) WILL BE PERFORMED.    20230308 UPDATE:  THE MECHANICAL AND METALLURGICAL REPORT IS COMPLETE AND IS INPUT INTO THE ONGOING RCFA. THE REPORT DETERMINED THAT A LACK OF FUSION ON THE INSIDE DIAMETER CAUSED STRESS CONCENTRATIONS THAT INITIATED TOE CRACKS WHICH PROPAGATED TO THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OVER TIME. THE ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF COMMODITY RELEASED UNINTENTIONALLY AND RECOVERED HAVE BEEN UPDATED, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATED COSTS.    20230517 UPDATE:  THE RCFA WAS PUBLISHED ON APRIL 21, 2023. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE WAS A PROGRESSIVE FATIGUE CRACK THAT ORIGINATED AT A GIRTH WELD CONNECTING A MANUFACTURED ELBOW FITTING TO THE PIPE CONSTRUCTED ACROSS MILL CREEK. THIS GIRTH WELD TRANSITIONED THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS FROM THE ELBOW FITTING TO THE ADJACENT PIPE JOINT AND WAS COMPLETED AT A FABRICATION FACILITY. THE RCFA CONFIRMED THE WELDING WORKMANSHIP WAS COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE CODES AND STANDARDS.    DURING INSTALLATION, THE PIPE SEGMENT WAS SUBJECT TO INADVERTENT BENDING STRESSES SUFFICIENT TO INITIATE A CRACK AT A SHALLOW LACK OF FUSION FEATURE IN THE SUBJECT GIRTH WELD. BENDING STRESSES DURING INSTALLATION ALSO LED TO A DEFORMATION IN THE ELBOW FITTING AND A WRINKLE IN THE ADJACENT PIPE JOINT. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF THE WELD TRANSITION CREATED A STRESS CONCENTRATION POINT, MAKING THE PIPE AT THIS LOCATION MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BENDING STRESSES. THIS RESULTED IN THE INITIATION OF A CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK IN THE WELD, WHICH LED TO FAILURE THROUGH OPERATING CYCLES OVER 11.5 YEARS.    THE ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF COMMODITY RELEASED UNINTENTIONALLY AND RECOVERED HAVE BEEN UPDATED, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATED COSTS.    20231102 UPDATE:  ESTIMATED COSTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED.",4723.0,0.0,1440.0,80.06944444444444,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049999999999999,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

VENT VALVE 1008 WAS LOCKED CLOSED TO PREVENT RECURRENCE DURING INVESTIGATION.  MILFORD COMPRESSOR STATION HAS ADEQUATE PROTECTION IN THE EVENT OF AN ESD.  ON MARCH 23, 2018, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOLENOID CASING THAT CONTROLS THE VALVE HAD AN ACCUMULATION OF WATER.  THE SEAL PROTECTING THE SOLENOID WAS NOT FULLY SEALED.  WATER WAS REMOVED AND THE SEAL WAS FIXED.  ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION IS IN PROGRESS TO REVIEW ELECTRONICS OF THE SYSTEM.    UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT AN EXCESS OF CURRENT TO THE CONTROL MODULE CAUSED THE SOLENOID CONTROLLING VALVE 1008 TO FAIL.  THE CONTROL MODULE WAS REPLACED AND UPGRADED.  DTE CONTROL MAINTENANCE TESTED ALL THE REMAINING CONTROL MODULES FOR VENT VALVES AT MILORD.  IT WAS FOUND THAT ALL THE CURRENT READINGS WERE WITHIN THE OUTPUT LIMITS OF THE MODULES BEFORE PUTTING THE STATION BACK INTO SERVICE.

THE CONTROLLER SUSPECTED A LEAK AND NOTIFIED THE IOWA STATION OPERATOR TO SHUT DOWN THE PUMPS.  LOCAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED AND PLACED ON STANDBY ONCE THE LOCATION WAS CONFIRMED.  AT 23:58, A FARMER REPORTED A FIRE IN HIS FIELD NEAR AERIAL MARKER (AM) 76 / MILEPOST (MP) 16.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA.  THE CONTROLLER BLOCKED IN THE MOVS AT AM 115 / MP 55 AND AM 177 / MP 116.  LOCAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL CLOSED MANUAL BLOCK VALVES AT AM 71 / MP 11, AM 86 / MP 26 AND AM 87 / MP 27. A 1-MILE SAFETY BUFFER WAS ESTABLISHED AROUND THE LEAK SITE, TRAFFIC WAS BLOCKED AND ALL HOMES WERE EVACUATED WITHIN THE BUFFER ZONE.    AT 02:35 ON 8/13/2013, LOCAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO GET CLOSER TO THE LEAK SITE AND CLOSED THE BLOCK VALVE AT AM 76 / MP 16.  THIS ISOLATED THE LEAKING SEGMENT BETWEEN AM 76 / MP 16 AND AM 86 / MP 26.  THE AREA WAS SECURED AND PRESERVED FOR EXAMINATION BY A THIRD-PARTY.      AFFECTED PIPE WAS CUT OUT AND SENT IN FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS ALONG WITH THE PIECES THAT WERE COLLECTED.  THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS REPLACED AND THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 8/17/2013.     =================NOTES============================  THROUGH A REVIEW OF SCADA DATA, THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS LATER DETERMINED TO BE AT 23:10 ON AUGUST 12, 2013 AS INDICATED BY A RAPID PRESSURE DROP ON THE LINE PRESSURE AND DISCHARGE PRESSURE AT WILLOW STATION.       THE EVACUATION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC WAS CARRIED OUT BY LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS.  THE RESPONSE PROVIDED IN PART A QUESTION 17 IS THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT WERE EVACUATED.  THE EXACT NUMBER OF PEOPLE EVACUATED CANNOT BE VERIFIED.      SOIL CONTAMINATION:  FOURTEEN SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE RUPTURE SITE, INCLUDING THE DEPRESSION, ONLY ONE SAMPLE ANALYSIS EXHIBITED BENZENE RESULTS.   THE BENZENE DETECTED IN THIS SAMPLE DID NOT EXCEED REGULATORY (IL EPA) SOIL STANDARDS AND THE ORIGINS OF THE DETECTION HAVE NOT BEEN CONFIRMED TO BE RESULTING FROM THIS RELEASE.    GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION:  ONE GROUNDWATER SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED FROM THE DEPRESSION, THIS SAMPLE ANALYSIS EXHIBITED BTEX (BENZENE, TOLUENE, ETHYL BENZENE, XYLENE) RESULTS ABOVE THE REGULATORY (IL EPA) GROUNDWATER STANDARDS AND THE ORIGINS OF THE DETECTION HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED TO BE RESULTING FROM THIS RELEASE.    =================METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS==================  RESULTS FROM THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY A DEFECT THAT FORMED IN THE LONGITUDINAL ERW SEAM OF THE PIPE.  THE DEFECT WAS A COMBINATION OF TWO FLAWS: AN EXTERNAL SURFACE-BREAKING HOOK CRACK AND A CRACK THAT FORMED AT THE BASE OF THE HOOK CRACK AND ENLARGED OVER TIME WHILE THE PIPE WAS IN SERVICE.  THE HOOK CRACK WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT FORMED WHEN THE PIPE WAS MANUFACTURED.   FRACTOGRAPHIC AND METALLOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION WAS UNABLE TO CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE IN-SERVICE FLAW GROWTH.      ===================8/15/2014 UPDATE===============  PART C #6.

HAMPSHIRE GAS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AT 4:10 AM AND OBSERVED A FIRE AT THE DEHYDRATOR FACILITIES AT THE SITE. THE REBOILER UNIT HAD CAUGHT FIRE. THE RESPONDING PERSONNEL MADE THE AREA SAFE BY VALVING OFF THE GAS TO THE INVOLVED FACILITY. THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT A PRESSURE REGULATING DEVICE FAILED TO REDUCE THE INCOMING PRESSURE TO THE LOWER SET POINT. THE PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATOR ALSO FAILED TO ACTIVATE TO RELIEVE THE OVERPRESSURE CONDITION. THESE FAILURES ALLOWED 600 PSI NATURAL GAS PRESSURE TO REACH THE LOW PRESSURE REGULATORS UTILIZED FOR INSTRUMENT GAS AND BURNER FUEL GAS IN THE DEHYDRATOR EQUIPMENT. THESE FIVE LOW PRESSURE DEVICES EXPERIENCED BRITTLE METAL FAILURE FROM THE HIGH PRESSURE GAS AND LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURES. THE FRACTURED METAL AND STEEL SET SCREWS FROM THE LOW PRESSURE REGULATORS STRUCK THE CONCRETE PAD AND STEEL SKID SUPPORT STRUCTURE CREATING SPARKS THAT MAY HAVE PROVIDED A POSSIBLE IGNITION SOURCE FOR THE ESCAPING NATURAL GAS. THE NOTICE OF THE INCIDENT CAME FROM AN ALERTS FROM SCADA. INSTRUMENT FAULT ALERTS AND ABNORMAL VALUES AROUND THE REBOILER WERE NOTICED.

THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS THAT A THIRD PARTY TRUCK DRIVER OPERATING THE VALVES FOR UNLOADING DID NOT CLOSE THE BALL VALVE AFTER COMPLETING THE TASK TO FILL THE TANK. A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE LEAK WAS THAT THE CHECK VALVE ON THE LINE WAS NOT FULLY SEALED DUE TO SOLIDS THAT HAD BEEN FOUND ON THE SEAL.

(THIS WAS IN A SEPARATE, ADJACENT LOCATION FROM WHERE THE EXCAVATION WORK WAS LOCATED; WORK ON THE DIG WAS SUSPENDED WHEN THE WEEP WAS SIGHTED.)     THE PURPOSE OF THE ISOLATION FITTING WAS TO ELECTRICALLY ISOLATE THE MAINLINE AND FACILITY PIPING CATHODIC PROTECTION SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE OPTIMAL CORROSION PROTECTION. THIS FITTING WAS INSTALLED DURING INITIAL CONSTRUCTION. CURRENTLY, THE ISOLATION FITTING IS NOT NEEDED DUE TO UPGRADES TO THE CATHODIC PROTECTION SYSTEMS, AND IT HAS BEEN ELECTRICALLY BYPASSED. PS10 HAS BEEN OUT OF SERVICE SINCE 1998 AND WAS STRAIGHT PIPED IN 2013.     INITIAL REPORTS CONCERNING THE WEEP WERE THAT THE SUBSTANCE WAS POTENTIALLY CRUDE AND A SPILL REPORT WAS FILED. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT (LEL) GAS MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF TAR-BASED PACKING MATERIAL IN THE ISOLATION FITTING, THE PRECISE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE WAS INITIALLY UNCLEAR. THUS ALYESKA SENT A SAMPLE OF THE SUBSTANCE FROM PS10 AND A SAMPLE OF NORTH SLOPE CRUDE OUT FOR A LABORATORY ANALYSIS. TEST RESULTS RECEIVED JUNE 4, 2015, INDICATE THE WEEPING MOISTURE ON THE ISOLATION FLANGE AT PS10 IS WEATHERED CRUDE OIL.     INITIALLY, THE WEEP RATE WAS ABOUT ONE DRIP PER SECOND, APPARENTLY DUE TO THE ACCUMULATION OF CRUDE WITHIN THE TAR MEMBRANE/PACKING MATERIAL WITHIN THE FITTING. THE ORIGINAL WEEP LATER STOPPED ON ITS OWN, BUT THERE IS NOW ADDITIONAL MINOR WEEPING. ALYESKA HAS EXCAVATED APPROXIMATELY 5 YARDS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL. ALL EXCAVATION HAS BEEN DONE BY HAND THUS FAR. THERE IS NO INDICATION HOW LONG THE WEEP HAS BEEN ACTIVE AND THE TOTAL VOLUME EXTRUDED IS UNCERTAIN.      TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS FOR REPAIR AND REMEDIATION ARE BEING EVALUATED. CONTINGENCY SPILL MEASURES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE, INCLUDING 24-HOUR SITE MONITORING; SECONDARY CONTAINMENT (PIPE CAP); STAGING OF A CREW WITH A VAC TRUCK; AND PLACEMENT OF AN RB-100 (ACTUATOR) AND GENERATOR ON-SITE FOR CONTINGENCY CLOSURE OF THE VALVE.   PROTOCOLS ARE ALSO BEING DEVELOPED FOR ASSESSMENT OF OTHER ISOLATION FITTINGS (21) LOCATED ALONG THE TAPS SYSTEM.     UPDATE: ON JULY 13, 2015, A 60-INCH CONTAINMENT SLEEVE WITH GROUT INJECTION AND SEAL WELDING OF PLUGS WAS COMPLETED. THE WEEP IS REPAIRED THOUGH ALYESKA HAS FINAL INSTALLATION OF CONICAL ENDS FOR THE SLEEVE SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2015. ALYESKA HAS CONTRACTED STRESS ENGINEERING TO CONDUCT A CAUSE ANALYSIS FOR THIS EVENT. ALYESKA CONTINUES INVESTIGATIONS OF OTHER ISOLATION FITTINGS ON TAPS TO ENSURE NO OTHER FAILURES HAVE OCCURRED. TO DATE, SEPTEMBER 10, 2015, NO ADDITIONAL LEAKS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.     UPDATE: THE CONICAL ENDS INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2015.     UPDATE: THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FOR THIS INCIDENT WAS COMPLETE ON MARCH 1, 2016. THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO BOTH POST CONSTRUCTION SETTLING CAUSING THE PIPE TO BEND, COUPLED WITH A 7.9 EARTHQUAKE IN 2002 CENTERED 3 MILES FROM THE PIPELINE.

VERNON) TO THE GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER. GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS) RESPONDED AND OBTAINED A 60% GAS-IN-AIR READING AT THE 20' LINE OF #426 E 4 ST. THE LEAK WAS CLASSIFIED TYPE-1 DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO THE 24"" TRANSMISSION MAIN (230 PSI). GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND SUPERVISION RESPONDED, INVESTIGATED AND AT 1536 HRS IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEAK MAY BE COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION MAIN. THE 12"" 1957 STEEL TRANSMISSION INLET TO GAS REGULATOR GR-514 WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK IN THE VICINITY OF A DRIP POT AND RISER. GR-514 WAS VALVED OFF AND THE LEAK EXCAVATED AFTER PRESSURE WAS BLED DOWN. THE EXCAVATION DETERMINED THE ACTUAL SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS ON A 1"" COUPLING IN THE DRIP RISER AT THE INLET PIPING TO GR-514. PRESSURE CONTROL, GAS CONTROL AND GAS ENGINEERING DETERMINED THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY NEGATIVE SYSTEM IMPACT DUE TO THE LOSS OF THIS TRANSMISSION PRESSURE TO HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR STATION.   TRANSMISSION VALVES 25960 AND 28563 WERE CLOSED AT 1705 HRS AND PRESSURE REDUCTION THROUGH GR-514. THE LEAKING COUPLING WAS REMOVED AND A WELDED CAP INSTALLED ON THE DRIP POT WHERE THE RISER CONNECTS TO THE DRIP POT, REMOVING THE HAZARD. THE REGULATOR STATION REMAINED OFFLINE WHILE ADDITIONAL PLANNED WORK REPLACING 70' OF THE AFFECTED SECTION OF INLET PIPING TO THE REGULATOR STATION WAS COMPLETED. THE PIPELINE WORK WAS COMPLETED, AND THE MAIN RESTORED TO FULL SERVICE ON NOVEMBER 9, 2010 AT 23:01 HRS. THE US DOT AND NYS PSC WERE NOTIFIED.

PERSONNEL DISCOVERED AN APPROXIMATE 1 BBL RELEASE AT THE BOOSTER PUMP. ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO ASSIST WITH RESPONSE.  ALL FREE PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED AND CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS REMOVED FOR ON-SITE REMEDIATION. PRIOR TO THE FAILURE THE BOOSTER PUMP HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AND SENT TO A 3RD PARTY FOR REBUILD. ONCE THE BOOSTER PUMP WAS RETURNED IT WAS PUT BACK INTO SERVICE. THE FAILURE OCCURRED AFTER APPROXIMATELY 25 HRS OF USE AFTER ITS RETURN TO SERVICE.  AFTER THE FAILURE THE BOOSTER PUMP WAS AGAIN REMOVED AND SENT OFF FOR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE FAILURE CAUSE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE INTERNAL PARTS WERE NOT TORQUED PROPERLY FROM THE REBUILD. EXCESSIVE VIBRATION CAUSED A BEARING TO FAIL IN THE BOOSTER PUMP CAUSING THE SEAL FAILURE WHICH ALLOWED THE RELEASE TO OCCUR.  THE BOOSTER PUMP HAS BEEN REPAIRED BY ANOTHER VENDOR AND RETURNED TO SERVICE.,7489.0,0.0,285.0,52.63157894736842,1.0,0.0,0.0,29.32,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ONCE ENBRIDGE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON LOCATION, THEY DISCOVERED CRUDE OIL IN CONTAINMENT, INSIDE THE BERM OF TANK 3011.  ENBRIDGE CHECKED THE TANK LEVEL ON TANK 3011, WHICH WAS UNCHANGED.  ENBRIDGE THEN BLOCKED THE RELIEF LINE TO TANK 3010 AND OPENED UP THE LINE TO TANK 3013.  THE LEVEL ON TANK 3010 STABILIZED AFTER THE RELIEF LINE WAS CLOSED.  ENBRIDGE MADE INITIAL NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NRC.  CLEAN-UP BEGAN IMMEDIATELY, WITH ENBRIDGE HANDLING INITIAL EFFORTS.      ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2019 AT 13:21, HOLLY ENERGY PARTNERS (HEP) AND ENBRIDGE DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK ORIGINATED AT A CORROSION FAILURE ON A RELIEF LINE.  HEP TOOK OVER CLEAN-UP EFFORTS ON SEPTEMBER 14 AND NOTIFIED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AT 13:47. HEP FILED A WRITTEN    F 7000.1 ACCIDENT REPORT ON OCTOBER 14, 2019.    HEP HAS COMPLETED A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED PIPE SEGMENT AND HAS RESOLVED JURISDICTIONAL AND OWNERSHIP UNCERTAINTIES.  AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE, HEP DID NOT BELIEVE THAT IT OWNED THE RELIEF LINE. HEP THEN INVESTIGATED THE DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO ITS 2015 ACQUISITION OF THE NEARBY OSAGE PIPELINE FOR MORE INFORMATION.  WHILE OUR REVIEW DID NOT CONCLUSIVELY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RELIEF LINE CONVEYED IN THAT ACQUISITION, HEP HAS DECIDED TO RESOLVE THE UNCERTAINTY BY TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RELIEF LINE.  HEP ALSO EVALUATED THE JURISDICTIONAL STATUS OF THE RELIEF LINE AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE LINE PROVIDES SURGE RELIEF TO AN OSAGE PIPELINE HEADER THAT RECEIVES OIL FROM THIRD PARTY, PART 195 REGULATED PIPELINES.      HEP'S THIRD PARTY METALLURGICAL CONTRACTOR EVALUATED TWO PIPE SAMPLES FROM THE RELIEF LINE.  THE CONTRACTOR OBSERVED INTERNAL CORROSION PITTING, CHARACTERIZED ITS MORPHOLOGY, AND CONCLUDED THAT MICROBIAL INDUCED CORROSION (MIC) WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR THE INTERNAL CORROSION.  HEP HAS EVALUATED AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RELIEF LINE AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A DEAD LEG, THAT CONTAINED CRUDE OIL WITHOUT REGULAR FLOW.  IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS LOW-FLOW ENVIRONMENT CONTRIBUTED TO THE MIC THAT LED TO THE FAILURE.      CONSIDERING THESE FINDINGS, HEP HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO IMPROVE SAFETY OF THE RELIEF LINE AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE FAILURES, INCLUDING:     REPLACED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RELIEF LINE WITH INTERNALLY-COATED STEEL PIPE.  THE INTERNAL COATING (SHERWIN WILLIAMS NOVA-PLATE 360) IS A PTFE BASE THAT LINES THE ENTIRE PIPE.  INTERNAL SLEEVES WERE USED AT FIELD JOINTS, AND WERE PROTECTED DURING WELDING WITH BACKING STRIPS, AND WERE BONDED TO THE INTERIOR OF THE LINE.   HEP HAS INSTALLED AND IS MONITORING ONE CORROSION COUPON ON THE RELIEF LINE.   DEVELOPED A LINE FLUSHING AND CHEMICAL INJECTION PROCEDURE FOR THE RELIEF LINE.  THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEDURE IS TO PERIODICALLY SWEEP THE LINE OF STAGNANT CRUDE AND INJECT CORROSION INHIBITOR AS NECESSARY.    INSTALLED A CHECK VALVE IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM FROM THE ENBRIDGE RELIEF TANK (TANK 3010), TO PREVENT BACK-FLOW FROM THE TANK.",3178.0,0.0,285.0,86.66666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,26.68,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

WHILE ON THE PHONE SSC GAS CONTROL ISSUED A ZERO SET POINT AT THE FLOW CONTROL FOR THE SSC CASHION SETTING AND THE RELEASE OF GAS WAS CONFIRMED TO BE STOPPED AT 09:57.  AT 09:58 SSC GAS CONTROL NOTIFIED PSAP THAT A RELIEF VALVE HAD BEEN GOING OFF IN THE AREA BUT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED TO HAVE STOPPED.  SSC GAS CONTROL NOTIFIED SSC OPERATIONS AT 09:58 TO TRAVEL TO THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE.  SSC OPERATIONS ARRIVED ON SITE AT 12:12, AFTER INITIAL TESTING THE RELIEF VALVE ACTIVATED DURING TEST AT SET PRESSURE AND RESEATED PROPERLY.  NO ISSUES WERE FOUND WITH THE RELIEF VALVE.  SSC GAS CONTROL REVIEWED FLOWS OF THE SETTING AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE METER BEGAN SHOWING NO FLOW AT APPROXIMATELY 15:00 ON 12/10/15.  BEFORE THAT POINT THE METER WAS RECEIVING BETWEEN 5-6 MMCF/DAY RATE.  AFTER DISCUSSING THIS WITH SUPERIOR CASHION, THEY STATED THEY HAD NOT SHUT DOWN THEIR FLOWS.  AT THE TIME WHEN THE FLOW WENT TO 0 THE PRESSURE ON THE SEGMENT WAS AT 360 PSIG, 53 POUNDS UNDER MAOP, AND THEN DROPPED AND SETTLED AT 343 PSIG.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE BEGAN RELIEVING AT 14:50 ON 12/10/2015 AND CONTINUED TO BLOW UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SSC RECEIVED A CALL.  THE PRESSURE SHOWED A STABILIZATION BECAUSE THERE IS A CHECK VALVE BETWEEN THE RELIEF AND THE METER SETTING AND THE CLOSURE OF THIS VALVE TO PREVENT BLOWING DOWN THE SSC MAINLINE WOULD CAUSE THE METER SETTING TO MEASURE THE SAME PRESSURE AS THE MAINLINE WITH 0 FLOW.  SSC CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER AND DETERMINED THERE WAS A PERIOD WHEN THEY HAD DELIVERED HIGHER PRESSURE GAS.  ONCE THE HIGH PRESSURE GAS SLUG REACHED THE RELIEF VALVE IT ACTIVATED.  THE RELIEF VALVE ACTIVATED AS INTENDED, BUT SSC WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE THE GAS RELEASE DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE CHECK VALVE.  BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER HAD REACHED NOMINATION FOR THE DAY GAS CONTROL DID NOT SEE ANY ISSUE WITH THE METER READING 0 FLOW (NO FLOW).

IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE KROHNE METERS AT BOTH TANK 204 AND TANK 202 HAD ACQUIRED WAX AND REQUIRED CLEANING. ALL LEASES GOING TO THE VENTURA TANK FARM WERE SHUT DOWN UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING AFTER THE METERS WERE CLEANED.     AT 08:00 SUNDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2013, THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR, TWO PIPELINE OPERATORS, AN AUTOMATION & INTEGRATION SPECIALIST, AND VACUUM TRUCK DRIVER MET AT THE VENTURA TANK FARM TO COMPLETE THE CLEANING OF THE KROHNE METERS. ONLY ONE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER WAS ON SHIFT AT THE TIME. THE FIELD OPERATORS FIRST COMPLETED THE METER AT TANK 204 WITH NO COMPLICATIONS BY 09:45. ONCE THE CLEANING OF THE METER AT TANK 202 HAD BEEN COMPLETED, THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE CONTROL CENTER FOR STARTUP. NO COUNTS WERE OBTAINED BY THE METER AND THE LINE TO TANK 202 WAS SHUT DOWN. THE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER NOTIFIED THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR THAT THE LINE WAS FLOWING AT A HIGH RATE. THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR SUGGESTED THAT IT MAY BE DUE TO A VOID IN THE LINE. THE LINE WAS THEN RESTARTED. THE METER CONTINUED TO NOT RECEIVE COUNTS AND THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR DECIDED TO COVER THE LINE WITH A PIPELINE OPERATOR. THE RELEASE AT TAYLOR LEASE WAS DISCOVERED AT 12:30.    DURING SPILL RESPONSE CLEANING, VALVE BV 1016 AT THE TAYLOR LEASE WAS FOUND DAMAGED INTO TWO PIECES. THE VALVE WAS A 125 SERIES LOCATED ON A 150 SERIES LINE AND WAS NOT PART OF THE VALVE MAINTENANCE LIST. PROTECTIVE DEVICE DRAWINGS AND PIPELINE INSTRUMENTATION DRAWINGS DID NOT IDENTIFY THE VALVE AS A 125 SERIES VALVE. THE LINE HAD OVER PRESSURED AND RELIEVED PRESSURE AT VALVE BV 1016. AFTER REVIEW OF THE ALARM LOGS, A HIGH HIGH PRESSURE ALARM OCCURRED AT 08:44 AT THE VENTURA MANIFOLD AND ANOTHER AT 10:04 ON THE TAYLOR LINE. ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, AT 10:56, A LOW LOW PRESSURE ALARM OCCURRED AT BOTH THE VENTURA MANIFOLD AND TAYLOR LINE. THE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER WAS UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THESE ALARMS AS AN ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITION AND WAS VIEWING IT AS AN ANOMALY AT THE TIME.     DURING CLEANING, VALVE V 1035 AND MOV 12 WERE CLOSED, HOLDING PRODUCT THROUGHOUT THE TAYLOR LEASE LINE. OVER TIME THE CRUDE OIL BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THERMAL EXPANSION AND THE LINE BEGAN TO OVERPRESSURE DUE TO A RISE IN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES. VALVE BV 1016 WAS A CAST IRON 125 SERIES VALVE AND WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THE 150 SERIES LINE. VALVE BV 1016 COULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE TO THAT DEGREE AND FAILED.     IN ADDITION, PRESSURE ALARMS RECEIVED BY THE CONTROL CENTER WERE NOT PROPERLY RECOGNIZED. THE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER WAS UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE PATTERN OF ALARMS AS A LEAK TREND.

ALL WORKERS WERE SAFELY EVACUATED FROM INSIDE TANK. NO PRODUCT RELEASED TO GROUND. FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MUTUAL AID RESPONDED TO FIRE AND EXTINGUISHED FIRE. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED AND FINALIZED BY SMES.  MOST LIKELY, GASOLINE VAPORS ACCUMULATED IN THE RIM SPACE DUE TO GAPS BETWEEN THE TANK WALL AND THE PRIMARY SEAL ALLOWING VAPORS TO PASS BY THE PRIMARY SEAL AND INTO THE RIM SPACE. THE LARGEST OBSERVED GAPS BETWEEN THE PRIMARY SEAL SHOE AND THE TANK WALL WERE AT THE LOCATIONS OF THE BUTT STRAPS AND RIVETS OF THE TANK WALL. GASOLINE VAPORS LIKELY BECAME TRAPPED AND ACCUMULATED IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE INSTALLED SECTION OF NEW SECONDARY SEAL AND THE PRIMARY SEAL, CREATING A FLAMMABLE ATMOSPHERE.  THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF IGNITION WAS CONTACT BETWEEN THE FLAMMABLE MIXTURE OF GASOLINE VAPORS IN THE RIM SPACE WITH A HOT METAL SURFACE ABOVE THE AUTO IGNITION TEMPERATURE OF GASOLINE, AT THE LOCATION WHERE A SCREW WAS BEING USED TO INSTALL THE SECONDARY SEAL MATERIAL.     THE INVESTIGATION TEAM ALSO OBTAINED THAT IF A SCREW BEING INSTALLED WITH A PNEUMATIC IMPACT WRENCH INTO THE Z-PLATE COULD GENERATE ENOUGH HEAT TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE ABOVE THE AUTO IGNITION POINT OF GASOLINE, WHICH IS IN THE RANGE OF 480-530 ºF.",33399.0,1.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.49,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED BY MAINLINE BLOCK-VALVES UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE LOCATION AND STOPPLES HAD BEEN SET ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WORK SITE.  A MUD PLUG VAPOR BARRIER WAS INSTALLED BEFORE PERFORMING THE FINAL TIE-IN WELD.  TO MAKE THE FINAL TIE-IN WELD THE MAINLINE PIPE WAS CUT TO ENSURE PROPER FIT.  ONCE THE FINAL CUT WAS MADE A WORKER MOVED THE MUD PLUG FARTHER INTO THE PIPE TO ENABLE THE WELDER TO MAKE HIS WELD.  THE MUD PLUG WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND ATMOSPHERIC TESTING DOWNSTREAM OF THE MUD PLUG WAS CONDUCTED WITH NO HYDROCARBONS DETECTED.

IN THE INTERIM, EQUITRANS PLANS TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES TO INFORM THE RCFA AND ENSURE WELL INTEGRITY PER PHMSA SAFETY REGULATIONS AND API 1171.      1- INSTALLING REAL TIME PRESSURE MONITORS ON THE ANNULUS OF ALL RAGER MOUNTAIN GAS STORAGE WELLS.  2- REANALYZING THE 2016 VERTILOG WIRELINE RESULTS OF THE PRODUCTION CASING FROM WELL 2244 USING THE MOST RECENT SOFTWARE.  3- CONDUCTING A NEW WIRELINE SURVEY (ASSESSMENT) OF THE PRODUCTION CASINGS FOR THE OTHER WELLS WITH A HIGH DEFINITION, METAL LOSS VERTILOG TOOL.  4- EVALUATING ANY OTHER MECHANICAL GAS MIGRATION PATHWAYS BETWEEN THE PRODUCTION AND INTERMEDIATE CASING  5- REVIEWING EXISTING STORAGE WELL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PROCEDURES BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM SHUTTING IN WELL 2244 TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS.  ***FEBRUARY 2023 SUPPLEMENT***   NOTIFICATION OF THE INCIDENT CLARIFICATION: AT 3:28 PM  ON 11/6/2022 EQUITRANS WAS NOTIFIED BY ANOTHER OPERATOR IN THE AREA (PEOPLES) WHO RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM CAMBRIA COUNTY 911 SERVICE. EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE ON SITE WHEN EQUITRANS ARRIVED AT 4:15 PM. EQUITRANS EMPLOYEES VERIFIED THE ASSET WAS EQUITRANS GSW 2244  AND WERE IN COMMUNICATION WITH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ON SITE.     INVENTORY REDUCTION AND COSTS: FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, EQUITRANS CONDUCTED A TEST TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL CHANGE IN INVENTORY AT THE RAGER STORAGE RESERVOIR. THE RESULTS INDICATE AN ESTIMATED INVENTORY REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 1.29 BCF. EQUITRANS CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE ALLOTMENT OF THIS INVENTORY REDUCTION THAT MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO VENTING OR POTENTIAL MIGRATION. IN THIS REPORT, EQUITRANS ESTIMATES GAS COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $3MM (LINE D7F AND D7H), WHICH IS BASED ON A POTENTIAL 2023 UNIT PRICE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRETY OF THE ESTIMATED 1.29 BCF OF INVENTORY REDUCTION, AND ESTIMATED TOTAL COST OF $10.75MM (LINE D7I). EQUITRANS INCLUDES THIS INFORMATION FOR REPORTING PURPOSES ONLY; INCLUDING SUCH INFORMATION DOES NOT REQUIRE OR IMPLY THAT EQUITRANS WILL INCUR SUCH COSTS.    ***FEBRUARY 2024 SUPPLEMENT***  THE RCFA WAS SUBMITTED TO PHMSA ON AUGUST 24, 2023. AN UNREDACTED COPY IS AVAILABLE IN PHMSA'S PUBLIC READING ROOM. THE RCFA INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DIRECT AND ROOT CAUSES OF THE INCIDENT AND THE ALLOTMENT OF INVENTORY CHANGE. EQUITRANS LATER SUBMITTED A REMEDIAL WORK PLAN AND AN INJECTION PLAN TO PHMSA SEEKING AUTHORITY TO RESUME INJECTIONS AT RAGER USING ALL WELLS EXCEPT THREE, WHICH REMAIN DISCONNECTED. ON OCTOBER 2, 2023, PHMSA APPROVED THE INJECTION PLAN. EQUITRANS BEGAN INJECTION AT RAGER ON OCTOBER 5, 2023. ON NOVEMBER 16, 2023, PHMSA ISSUED A LETTER TO EQUITRANS APPROVING ITS REQUEST TO REMOVE ALL PRESSURE RESTRICTION AT RAGER.  FOR THIS FINAL REPORT, EQUITRANS UPDATED THE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR LINES D7B, D7C, AND D7E IN THE APPROPRIATE CELLS. THE COSTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SHOW IN LINE D7D HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO LINE D7B. SUMMING (A) THE LINE D7E UPDATED SUBTOTAL AND (B) THE AMOUNT FOR LINE D7H FROM THE FEBRUARY 2023 SUPPLEMENT RESULTS IN AN ESTIMATED TOTAL COST OF $21,651,992 (LINE D7I).",11320.332761578045,0.0,3200.0,96.5,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.66,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

NO LIQUID WAS RELEASED. PAA INITIATED ITS STANDARD INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL NOTIFICATION PROTOCOLS. PAA CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM (CMT), INCLUDING THE CORPORATE CMT, WERE ACTIVATED. THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY PAA PERSONNEL, TANK FIREFIGHTING EXPERIENCED EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTORS, AND LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS/RESPONDERS, AND THE TANK LATER REMOVED FROM SERVICE. TO PREVENT FUTURE INCIDENTS, PAA WILL REQUIRE A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE TO REMAIN WITHIN LINE OF SIGHT DURING ALL IN-SERVICE SEAL REPLACEMENTS ON TANKS TO ENSURE ONLY SPARK RESISTANT TOOLS ARE USED. SINCE THE FIRE RESULTED IN AN EMISSIONS EVENT, TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WAS NOTIFIED PER 30 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §101.201. PAA MADE A COURTESY CALL AT 8:41 A.M. TO PHMSA SOUTHWEST REGION STAFF WHO REQUESTED PAA MAKE A COURTESY NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC). PAA PLACED A CALL TO NRC AT 9:00 A.M. & MADE A 48-HR FOLLOW UP CALL (REPORT #'S 1222913 & 1223012). PAA DID NOT INITIALLY COMPLETE A FORM 7000-1 REPORT AS IT DOES NOT BELIEVE ONE IS REQUIRED FOR AN EMISSIONS EVENT. BOTH 49 C.F.R. §195.54 AND §195.50 REQUIRE REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS THAT RESULT IN A RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS, DEFINED IN §195.2 AS ""PETROLEUM, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, OR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."" PETROLEUM IS DEFINED AS ""CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE, NATURAL GASOLINE, NATURAL GAS LIQUID, AND LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS."" THE TANKS AT WF STORE CRUDE OIL. THE CAUSE OF THE RIM FIRE WAS IGNITION OF FLAMMABLE VAPORS DURING ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. A CONTRACTOR FAILED TO FOLLOW PAA'S JOB SAFETY ANALYSIS AND THEIR OWN PROCEDURE TO USE SPARK RESISTANT TOOLS. NOWHERE IN THE DEFINITIONS PROVIDED IN §195.2 IS ""VAPOR"", OR ""FLAMMABLE VAPORS"", DEFINED. FURTHER, NOR ARE THEY INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF HAZARDOUS LIQUID, PETROLEUM, OR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. ELSEWHERE §195.438 EXPRESSLY USES THE TERMS ""FLAMMABLE HAZARDOUS LIQUID"" AND ""FLAMMABLE VAPORS"" TO IDENTIFY TWO DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT PHYSICAL STATES. THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF §195.52, AND §195.54 BY REFERENCE, APPLY TO THE RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS; NEITHER MENTIONS, ""FLAMMABLE VAPOR"" OR ""VAPORS"". BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF ITS REGULATIONS, PHMSA INTENDED THERE TO BE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS AND VAPORS; USING THEM ACCORDINGLY TO CREATE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH CIRCUMSTANCE. FURTHER, PHMSA DOES NOT CURRENTLY EQUATE EXCESS VAPOR LOSSES FROM AROUND BREAKOUT TANK SEALS AS A LIQUID RELEASE. MODIFYING THE REGULATIONS TO DO SO WOULD REQUIRE OPERATORS TO REPORT SUCH VAPOR LOSSES TO BOTH THE EPA (AS IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED) AND TO PHMSA. WHILE PAA DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT SUBMISSION OF A 7000-1 REPORT IS REQUIRED FOR THIS SPECIFIC INCIDENT, PAA IS IN GOOD FAITH SUBMITTING THE ATTACHED REPORT AT THE REQUEST OF PHMSA. IN DOING SO, PAA RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONTEST THE NECESSITY OF THE REPORT IN LATER PROCEEDINGS. §195.52 AND §195.54 ONLY APPLY IF §195.50 APPLIES. §195.50 IS SOLELY APPLICABLE TO RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS OR CARBON DIOXIDE. INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE SPILL VOLUME, PER §195.54, ON PHMSA FORM 7000-1 [PART A, QUESTION 9 (REV 12-2015)], STATES PRODUCT CONSUMED BY FIRE INSIDE A TANK IS NOT TO BE COUNTED IN THE SPILL VOLUME. THERE WAS NO RELEASE OF A HAZARDOUS LIQUID FROM THE TANK. ALL LOSSES CAME FROM PRODUCT CONSUMED BY FIRE INSIDE THE PERIMETER OF THE TANK WALL, AND IS THEREFORE NOT TO BE COUNTED AS SPILL VOLUME, AS WE BELIEVE IS SPECIFICALLY CONTEMPLATED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS, MAKING THE REPORTED SPILL VOLUME ""ZERO"". PAA MAINTAINS THAT THIS INCIDENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO §195.50, §195.52, OR §195.54.- OPERATORS ARE NOT ABLE TO SUBMIT REPORTS WITH UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE VOLUME LESS THAN .1.

(TGP) COMPRESSOR STATION 550 IN HAMILTON, ALABAMA. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:04AM TGP PERSONNEL AT THE STATION BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT THE STATION WAS NOT ISOLATED. ESD VALVE 550-AD2 WAS FOUND IN THE OPEN POSITION ALLOWING GAS TO PASS THROUGH AND OUT OF THE VENT STACK. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:06AM THE VALVE WAS SHUT, ENDING THE EVENT. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:54AM, THE GAS RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO EXCEED THE REPORTABLE THRESHOLD OF 3,000 MCF. THE EVENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED TO THE NRC AT 10:29AM. DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PILOT ON THE ESD VALVE CONTROLLER FOR VALVE 550-AD2 HAD FAILED DURING THE ESD AND DID NOT ALLOW ENOUGH GAS TO PASS THROUGH AND ACTUATE THE VALVE. THE PILOT WAS REPLACED AND THE STATION WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 6:55PM ON 10/22/2021.     THE ESD WAS TRIGGERED BY AN INADVERTENT KEY TURN IN THE CONTROL CABIN OF THE STATION, CAUSED BY CLOTHING ON A CONTRACTOR CATCHING AND TURNING THE KEY ON THE PANEL AS THE INDIVIDUAL WAS PASSING BY. THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT ON VALVE 550-AD2 REVEALED THAT, PER THE MANUFACTURER, THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE PILOT WAS ONE YEAR. THE PILOT HAD BEEN IN-SERVICE SINCE 2015. AT STATION 550, TGP WILL REVIEW THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF ALL ESD PILOTS AND REPLACE ANY THAT ARE PAST THE LIFE EXPECTANCY STATED BY THE MANUFACTURER. TGP REVOKED OQ'S PERTAINING TO THE AUTOMATED VALVE MAINTENANCE TASK FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO SERVICED ESD VALVE 550-AD2. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE RETRAINED ON VALVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES.

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS, A CASING VENT WAS TESTED FOR EVIDENCE OF A NON-HAZARDOUS NATURAL GAS LEAK INSIDE A CASING.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED TO ASSIST IN SECURING THE SITE PENDING FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND NECESSARY SAFETY MEASURES.  THE SEGMENT WAS ISOLATED BY COLUMBIA PERSONNEL AND THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN.  HENCE, THE SITE WAS SECURED.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, A DECISION WAS MADE TO REPLACE THE CASING AND THE PIPE WITH A PIPE.   UPON REMOVAL OF THE PIPE, AN EXTERNAL CORROSION PIT WITH 100 PERCENT WALL PENETRATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED NATURAL GAS RELEASE. THE CORROSION PIT WAS APPROXIMATELY 3.75 INCHES INSIDE OF THE NORTH END OF THE CASING AT THE 5 O'CLOCK POSITION WHEN FACING NORTH. THE PIT WAS AT A LOCATION OF DAMAGED OR MISSING COATING.  THE DAMAGED COATING WAS LOCATED UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR.  BOTH RUBBER ISOLATORS AND WOODEN CENTRALIZERS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN USE UPON REMOVAL OF THE CASING. HOWEVER, THE CARRIER PIPE WAS NOT CENTERED THROUGH THE CASING. WATER MARKS WERE OBSERVED ON BOTH THE CARRIER PIPE AND ON THE CASING, INDICATING THAT THE CASING SEALS HAD BEEN COMPROMISED AND, AT TIMES, WATER HAD BEEN PRESENT IN THE ANNULAR SPACE. WATER FLOWED OUT OF THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CASING WHEN THE SOUTH SIDE CASING SEAL WAS EXPOSED.  NO KNOWN SOIL CONDITIONS OR MEASURED POTENTIAL READINGS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION OR CATHODIC PROTECTION INTERFERENCE WERE OBSERVED.  1. THE EXTERNAL CORROSION PIT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF CORROSION AT THE SITE OF COATING DAMAGE UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CASING.  2. THE COATING DAMAGE LIKELY OCCURRED DURING INSTALLATION OF THE CASING OR DURING A SUBSEQUENT EXCAVATION OF THE CASING ENDS.  THE WOODEN CENTRALIZERS CAUSED AND/OR EXACERBATED THE COATING DAMAGE.  3. THE PLACEMENT OF THE CASING ISOLATOR OVER THE AREA OF DAMAGED COATING DID NOT ISOLATE THE EXPOSED STEEL FROM EVENTUAL ELECTROLYTE INTRUSION.  WITH WATER BEING PRESENT BETWEEN THE CASING SEAL AND THE PIPE, ATMOSPHERIC AND CREVICE CORROSION PITTED THE PIPE TO CAUSE THE LEAK. 4. THE INTRODUCTION OF WATER AS AN ELECTROLYTE TO THE EXPOSED STEEL CREATED A LOCALIZED CORROSION CELL UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR.  EXTERNAL CORROSION OCCURRED WHEN THE NON-LEVEL CASING FILLED WITH WATER COMPLETELY TO THE NORTH (HIGH) SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION OCCURRED WHEN THE CASING WAS NOT COMPLETELY FILLED.  5. DURING THE TIME WHEN THE CASING WAS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER, THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR SHIELDED THE EXPOSED STEEL FROM CATHODIC PROTECTION CURRENT THAT COULD HAVE MITIGATED THE CORROSION CELL DURING THAT TIME.  DURING THE TIME WHEN ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION WAS OCCURRING, ONLY RE-COATING THE EXPOSED STEEL OR MAINTAINING DRY CONDITIONS INSIDE THE CASING COULD HAVE MITIGATED THE CORROSION CELL.  KEY LESSONS LEARNED/CORRECTIVE MEASURES: 1) THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE CORROSION PIT THAT CAUSED THE LEAK MAKES IT DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO DETECT DURING TYPICAL, NON-EXCAVATION CASING POTENTIAL OR SHORT TESTS.  BECAUSE THE CORROSION OCCURRED IN AN ELECTRICALLY SHIELDED AREA, THE ONLY RELIABLE METHOD FOR DETECTION IS THE USE OF IN-LINE INSPECTION TOOLS.

TO ISOLATE THE LINE TO BE WORKED ON, THE PILOT GAS LINES BETWEEN THE  PILOT ISOLATION VALVE AND PILOT GAS SOLENOID WERE REQUIRED TO BE VENTED. IN ORDER TO PERFORM THIS TASK, THE FIREGATE VENT VALVES NEEDED TO BE IMMOBILIZED, TO PREVENT THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF GAS. THE NORMAL PROCEDURE TO COMPLETE THIS TASK IS TO ISOLATE THE LOCAL POWER GAS AT THE ACTUATOR, AND VENT THE LINE BETWEEN THE ISOLATION VALVE AND THE ACTUATOR, THEN ISOLATE THE PILOT GAS AT THE ACTUATOR, AND VENT THE LINE BETWEEN THE ISOLATION VALVE AND THE ACTUATOR. ALL POWER GAS LINES AND PILOT GAS LINES TO THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN VALVE ACTUATORS WERE ISOLATED, AND THE CREW BEGAN TO VENT THE PILOT LINES ON TWO OF THE VALVES, VALVE 612 AND VALVE 614. THIS RESULTED (AS DESIGNED) IN TWO FIREGATE VALVES (612 AND 614) TRAVELING TO 100% OPEN AND VENTING 3.484 MMCF OF NATURAL GAS FROM A 620 PSI LINE TO ATMOSPHERE THROUGH THE 16-FOOT VENT STACK, FROM 0816 HOURS TO 0825 HOURS. THE OPENED VALVES WERE MANUALLY CLOSED BY STATION PERSONNEL. AFTER RE-ASSESSMENT OF THE PROCEDURE AND SITUATION, STATION PERSONNEL RELIEVED PRESSURE OFF OF THE POWER GAS BETWEEN THE ISOLATION VALVE AND FIREGATE VENT VALVE ACTUATORS, AND THEN RELIEVED PRESSURE OFF THE PILOT GAS.    THE REQUIRED SEQUENCE TO ISOLATE FIREGATE VALVES IS TO ISOLATE POWER GAS AND THEN PILOT GAS. THIS SEQUENCE WAS NOT OUTLINED IN THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED.

DUE TO THE DELAYED NATURE OF THE FAILURE, CPL SELECTED ""PREVIOUS DAMAGE DUE TO EXCAVATION ACTIVITY"" AS THE EXCAVATION DAMAGE - SUB-CAUSE IN QUESTION G3; HOWEVER, STRONG CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INDICATE A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED IN NOVEMBER 2016 BY AN EXCAVATION CONTRACTOR ADDRESSING A PIPE FLAW FOUND DURING PIPE INSPECTION ACTIVITIES. THE DAMAGE DID NOT MANIFEST IMMEDIATELY SINCE THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE MECHANICAL DAMAGE CAUSED HEATING TO THE PARENT METAL DUE TO FRICTION AND CHANGED THE METALLIC STRUCTURE OF THE STEEL, WHICH RESULTED IN CRACK GROWTH UNTIL THE CRACK BECAME CRITICAL AND FAILED.    2. THE VOLUME OF PRODUCT RECOVERED IN QUESTION A11 IS UPDATED TO REFLECT THAT, SINCE THE PRIOR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT, ALL OIL HAS BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH FURTHER REMEDIATION EFFORTS. THESE FINAL FIVE BARRELS OF PRODUCT RECOVERED ARE REFLECTED IN THIS SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT.    3. THE TIME IN QUESTION A18B IS UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT DATE WHEN RESOURCES ARRIVED ONSITE, AND THE NARRATIVE SUBMITTED IN THE ORIGINAL FILING IS UPDATED TO NOTE THAT RESOURCES ARRIVED ON 02/18/2018, NOT 03/18/2018 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE ORIGINAL NARRATIVE IS UPDATED TO CLARIFY THAT RESOURCES ARRIVED AT 02:50, NOT 2:50 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.    4. THE COSTS REFLECTED IN QUESTION D8 ARE UPDATED.    5. QUESTION G3-1 IS UPDATED TO CLARIFY A COMBINATION INLINE INSPECTION TOOL WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 2013, WHICH INCLUDED MAGNETIC FLUX LEAKAGE, GEOMETRY, AND MAPPING TECHNOLOGIES.    6. QUESTION G3-3 IS UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT PRESSURE OF THE HYDROSTATIC TEST CONDUCTED IN 2009.    7. QUESTION G3-5A IS UPDATED BY REMOVING THE NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING COMPLETED IN 2016 SINCE THESE TESTS ACTUALLY OCCURRED NEAR THE FAILURE LOCATION BUT NOT IN LIKE PIPE.    8. QUESTIONS G3-9 THROUGH G3-17 ARE UPDATED TO INCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION REPORT'S CONCLUSION THAT THE ROOT CAUSE IS ""PREVIOUS DAMAGE"" AND TO REMOVE ANY ONE-CALL INFORMATION DUE TO THE LACK OF ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THE ONE-CALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOVEMBER 2016 REPAIR COINCIDED WITH THE EXCAVATION DAMAGE THAT ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THIS ACCIDENT.

UNIT 1 WAS NOT OPERATING AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE.  APPROXIMATELY 52 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED WITH ALL PRODUCT BEING CONTAINED TO THE PUMP BUILDING.  THE BULK OF THE VOLUME DRAINED INTO THE TRENCH SURROUNDING THE PUMP BASE. GRATING WAS REMOVED AND THE MAJORITY OF THE CRUDE OIL WAS VACUUMED OUT FOR REINJECTIONS.  THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS IDENTIFIED AS FAILED PUMP SEALS ON UNIT 1.  CRUDE OIL WAS CLEANED UP AND CLEAN UP MATERIAL WAS PROPERLY DISPOSED.  THE PUMP WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE FOR ADDITIONAL REPAIRS UNRELATED TO THE RELEASE.      AS A RESULT OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE FAILURE ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION GATHERED THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL CHECK VALVE SLAMMING EVENT WHICH CAUSED A WATER HAMMER EFFECT UPSTREAM OF THE UNIT 2 CHECK VALVE, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE FAILURE OF THE UNIT 1 MECHANICAL SEALS.  THE PRIMARY RING AND MATING RING FACES CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AS A RESULT OF THE WATER HAMMER, LEADING TO THE FRACTURE OF THE PRIMARY RING IN EACH OF THE MECHANICAL SEALS.
